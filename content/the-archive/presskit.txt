# The Archive: Press Kit

## Description

*The Archive* is a macOS note-taking application to increase writer productivity.

*The Archive* is be a powerful yet very clean tool to take notes. You no longer will be overwhelmed but impose your order on the chaos of information. *The Archive* will enrich your workflow with competent note-taking: Access knowledge in an instant and in order.

### Why Should You Write About The Archive?

The app is the implementation of a few core principles that value user autonomy and user data longevity first, fueled by a time-tested knowledge management method. We write about this method, called the *Zettelkasten Method*, [on our blog](http://zettelkasten.de/posts/).

This is not yet another general purpose information dump. It's a tool that only does the things that are needed to help writers write more. It's a powerhouse for information digesting and organic thinking. It's a creativity-fueling harbinger of new ideas. We think it is an Order-Bringing Weapon of Gods for the paladins of interestingness. We are, by the way, just mediums and very modest about our app. :)

### Paid Update Policy

We have a strong codex of software ethics, which is kind of special. The user interest and morality comes first, our revenue comes second.

We have a vision of the first version of _The Archive_. We are very up front about the features that will be included in version&nbsp;1 of *The Archive*, most importantly:

- Note quick entry from anywhere
- Saved searches, aka "Filters"
- Typewriter mode
- Customizable Markdown editor templates
- Browser-Type Navigation
- Dark Mode
- Tag Index
- Inline Image Preview
- Mass Text Replacement
- Scriptability

We don't like the thought of selling a paid version&nbsp;2 upgrade just because we need cash. We believe in being open and clear about our promises from the beginning. After the v1 is completed we will continue to ship stability updates and begin work on *The Archive* v2.

Customers who buy version&nbsp;1 now will pay less for v1 and the upgrade to v2 _combined_ that people who jump on with v2. That's one way we want to say "thank you" for our customer's support.

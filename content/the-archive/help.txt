## How to Get Help Inside the App

* For a quick overview of _The Archive_'s philosophy, check out *the welcome note*. You can add the note to your current archive directory from the Help menu: **Help ‣ Create Welcome Note…**
* To get tips on how to use the user interface, use the *App Guide* for a guided tour: **Help ‣ Show App Guide…**


## Check Out Our Forums

Out community of users is pretty amazing. You should get to know them! We'll answer any app-related questions on the forums, too, so those coming after you can benefit from your question.

## Hidden Preferences

Some settings in the app are not exposed as user-customizable preferences. But they can be changed via the `thearchive://` URL scheme. For some changes to take effect, you may have to relaunch the app.

To open these URLs, use the Terminal and use the `open` command, e.g.:

    open thearchive://preference/thePreferenceName/set/1234

This also works in your browser if you copy the URL (not the "open" at the beginning)!

- To set a preference, use the format `thearchive://preference/<PREFNAME>/set/<VALUE>`.
- To reset a changed preference to its built-in value, use the format `thearchive://preference/<PREFNAME>/delete`.

Currently supported preferences (replace `<PREFNAME>` with these):


- `debugMode` (boolean).<br>
  Default value: `false`.<br>
  Shows additional tools to help diagnose problems, and develop themes and scripts.

- `enableInlineImagePreview` (boolean).<br>
  Default value: `true`.<br>
  Turn the image preview on and off.

- `isHighlightingMarkdown` (boolean).<br>
  Default value: `true`.<br>
  Turn Markdown highlighting on and off.

- `isRestoringScrollPosition` (boolean).<br>
  Default value: `true`.<br>
  Turn restoring of the previously saved position when revisiting a note on and off. Turned off (`false`), selecting a note will always scroll to the top.

- `maxInlineImagePreviewHeight` (number).<br>
  Default value: `400` pixels.<br>
  Preview images will always shrink to fit to the text column's width. This value determines tha maximum height, so you don't fill multiple screens worth of scrolling with tall screenshots. We recommend a value no larger than half your screen height.

- `resultsCellHeightFactor` (fractional number).<br>
  Default value: `2.2`.<br>
  Changes the height of the search result list rows in relation to the text.

- `splitViewDividerAreaExpansion` (number).<br>
  Default is unset, effectively `0` pixels.<br>
  Affects the padding around the divider hairline that activates the resize functionality, indicated by the `←|→` mouse cursor.

- `timeZoneOverride` (string).<br>
  Default is unset, effectively using the system's time zone.<br>
  `<VALUE>` can be an abbreviation like `UTC` or `CEST` and is case-sensitve. New note IDs will be generated for the current time in that time zone.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I import Finder tags? (Applies to nvALT and DEVONthink, too)

nvALT stores the tags as so-called "Finder tags" in the file metadata. Same for DEVONthink's exported notes.

This is brittle and only works on Mac. _The Archive_ does not recognize these on purpose, so you don't tag yourself into a corner.

[We provide a **converter utility**](/the-archive/tag-converter/) that inserts missing `#hashtags` into your notes to match the Finder metadata. This should help with the transition!

### How do I create notes?

There are different ways to create a note, each with pros and cons depending on your workflow.

1. Type the note title you want into the Omnibar and hit Return. If you type a term in the Omnibar that is not used as the name of a note already, *The Archive* will create a matching note for you; if a note exists, it will be opened instead.
2. Use a Wiki-Link: create a link that leads nowhere, click on it to follow the link. There'll be no note to show, but the Omnibar contains the link now. Then create a note from the Omnibar as you would above. The Wiki-link feature is built on top of the search. Similar rules apply to entering a term in the Omnibar: if a note with the linked text exists, it will be displayed for you. If there is no matching note, you can hit Return from the Omnibar to create a note with the title set to the search term.
3. Create an empty note in *The Archive* without changing your search. Just hit <kbd>⌘N</kbd> (or pick **Note ‣ New** from the menu). The Archive will create a note for you that will be named "Untitled" and take you right into the editor. After you complete the note you can rename it by hitting <kbd>⌘R</kbd> (or via **Note ‣ Rename** from the main menu).
4. Use the "Quick Entry" popup window from anywhere on your system to capture a thought. You have to configure the shortcut in the application preferences (<kbd>⌘,</kbd>) to make it globally accessible.

### How do I create links between notes?

This is how we do it in _The Archive_ by default: every Zettel note gets its own address. This is the note's ID. ([Find out why identifiers are important.](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/add-identity/ "Blog Post: “You Only Find What You Have Identified”"))
An ID should never change: it must be fixed and stable. So the note title is not a good candidate as it may change over time. Moments in time are unique and also easy to generate.
We choose date-and-time IDs like `202305181056` which represents the date "2023-05-18 10:56am".

To create links between notes, you reference the target note by its address, aka its ID.

Even though it sounds obvious to use file names, an arbitrary ID (which should be *part* of the filename) is more stable.

*The Archive* tries to be helpful and aid you with these nifty `[[Double Bracket Wiki-Links]]`, which trigger a search. Adhering to the double-square-bracket convention of wikis, you get clickable links using Zettel IDs without buying into any proprietary file format or fragile file paths.

### How do I link to notes from other apps?

We believe that using a file path-based link isn't a very durable way to point to your notes. The links break once you move your notes to another directory or drive. This is true for links between notes, but also for incoming links from other apps. Instead, we suggest you simply use the ID of your notes and tell _The Archive_ to look up the result.

A link launches _The Archive_ and opens a matching note works with this **external link URL scheme**:

- `thearchive://match/TERM` works like the search but displays a good match directly; this is similar to `[[Wiki-Links]]`. You likely want to use this.
- `thearchive://search/TERM` searches for `TERM` as if you typed it in
- `thearchive://matchOrCreate/TERM` will create a note of the exact title `TERM` if that doesn't exist; it's similar to entering a search term into the Omnibar and hitting the return key.

For example, `thearchive://match/202305181051` will show the note matching "`202305181051`" in _The Archive_.

### How can I include images in my notes?

_The Archive_ stores notes as plain text, but you can display image files in your notes using the Markdown syntax:

```markdown
![image title](path/to/image.png)
```

The result looks like this:

<%= insert_image file: "/the-archive/img/image-embed.png", caption: "Image files are displayed inside editor" %>

The easiest way is to keep your images in your "media" sub-folder next to your notes and let _The Archive_ manage the files for you. Drag and drop images into your notes, and that's all you need.

- [Image drag & drop, and copy & paste](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/images-in-the-archive/): find out how to import images and manage image files;
- [Camera capturing](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/the-archive-image-capture/) makes it possible to use your Mac's camera (or your iPhone!) to snap pictures and include them in your notes.

### Can I use boolean search?

Yes! Here's how.

Operators are all caps: `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. `NOT` is alternatively expressed by the `!` prefix. `NOT b` is equal to `!b` and will show notes that have no "b" inside them. `! b` (note the space) evaluates as `! AND b`.

When you write `foo bar`, that's the same as writing `foo AND bar`. You can also connect phrases with `OR` to form a set union. Usually, phrases are "words", i.e. strings of characters separated by whitespace. You can group words into larger phrases with the use of quotation marks: `"the archive"` will only find this very phrase, sans quotation marks, and not each occurrence of "the" in your notes.

Phrase search wins: `"!b"` is a phrase search for "!b", matching the literal exclamation mark and letter. Instead of quotation marks, escaping works, too: `\!b`. Escaping _inside_ phrase searches will also work: `hello "you \"lovely\" specimen"`. You can also escape parts of reserved words, like the beginning of an operator: `\AND` will not be treated as an operator.

You can parenthesize expressions: `!(foo OR (baz AND !bar)` is equivalent to the expanded version, `!foo OR !baz AND !foo OR !bar`. Be aware that `OR` and `AND` do not have correct operator precedence. If you don't know what that means, you probably do not need to care.

### How can I assign custom shortcuts?

You can assign a shortcut to anything that's available in _The Archive_'s main menu. [Follow the excellent instructions by Apple.](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/create-keyboard-shortcuts-for-apps-mchlp2271/mac)

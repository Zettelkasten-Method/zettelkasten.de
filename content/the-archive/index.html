  <h2 id="our-software-ethics">Our Software Ethics</h2>

  <p><strong>Update Policy:</strong> We have a vision of the first version of <i>The Archive</i>. We are very up front about the features that will be included in version&nbsp;1 of <i>The Archive</i>. You can expect we implement all the features we announce for v1 and ship them as free updates. And we are bug hunters: we do our best to squash them all. <a href="/the-archive/roadmap/">Find out what we plan for version&nbsp;1!</a></p>

  <p><strong>Version Policy:</strong> We don&rsquo;t like the thought of selling a paid version&nbsp;2 upgrade just because we need cash. We believe in being open and clear about our promises from the beginning. After the v1 is completed we will continue to ship stability updates and begin work on <i>The Archive</i> v2.</p>

  <p><strong>We value loyalty a lot!</strong> If you are a proud owner of this first release, you are part of the club. v2 will come with a nice discount for you. You will pay less for v1 + v2 combined than those who join in v2.</p>

  <p><strong>Chaos is lurking.</strong> Being overwhelmed with information, projects and deadlines means chaos. Many don&rsquo;t take note taking seriously. But good note taking is the antidote to chaos. With a good tool you can tame the chaos and impose <em>your</em> will. Not any longer overwhelmed by the problem but with a clear vision of the path, you will tackle blogposts, books, scientific articles, and research with grace and stay in command, rather than react to the chaos surrounding you.</p>

  <p><i>The Archive</i> will be a powerful yet very clean tool to take notes. You no longer will be overwhelmed but impose your order on the chaos of information. <i>The Archive</i> will enrich your workflow with competent note taking: Access knowledge in an instant and in order.</p>

  <p>Take it seriously. Take notes. Take them well. Use <i>The Archive</i>, the weapon of the gods. </p>

      <blockquote class="quote"><p>It just shows how wise your decision to keep the data as simple as possible was in retrospect: in my other tool for thinking and research, implementing an overview of tags with a usage count would be impossible due to the proprietary maze of opaquely-named folders and subfolders this program creates.</p></blockquote>

      <blockquote class="quote"><p>I&#8217;m finding the simplicity and flexibility of The Archive are very attractive. Of those two, perhaps simplicity is the crucial factor at the moment (though I believe the two interact, and the one would not really work without the other). It has become obvious to me in only a couple of weeks of proper use of The Archive that the only thing to do is work on the actual text of your material. You could say that with other applications I have been suffering from &#8220;too many features&#8221; &#8211; called &#8220;distractions&#8221; in other kinds of discourse. For the first time in a long time, I&#8217;ve been looking at the actual words, because there isn&#8217;t anything else to play with, and realising that a lot of them are totally unnecessary, and are adding nothing. This is particularly the case with quotes I have extracted from various places. Often, if I break them down into single ideas, which I&#8217;m finding easier here, they are fairly unilluminating.</p></blockquote>

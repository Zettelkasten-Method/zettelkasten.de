## Creating Notes

- [Create new note from selecton](http://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/902/km-macro-create-new-zettel-from-selection)

- [Insert note header/template](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/10154/#Comment_10154)

## Getting Stuff into The Archive

- [Paste without newlines](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/13212/#Comment_13212), e.g. to copy from PDFs.
- [Copy link to mail, media, or website into The Archive](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/2122/3-quick-ways-to-create-a-markdown-link-from-mail-safari-and-finder) by @Will
- [Take screenshot and save into The Archive](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/11202/#Comment_11202): saves the picture in your media folder and prepares the Markdown to insert an image in your clipboard.
    - Good news: The Archive since v1.7 supports image pasting from the clipboard directly!

## Maintenance, Search and Replace

- [Rename note and update all links](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/1230/km-macro-rename-note-and-update-wikilinks-to-it/) by @seanakabry.
- [Global find and replace **for titles**](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/638/keyboard-maestro-macro-replacing-text-string-in-all-zettel-titles) in all notes, by @Vinho.
- [Global find and replace **for whole note contents**](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/641/keyboard-maestro-macro-replacing-text-string-in-all-zettels) by @Vinho.
- [Print all tags from .txt files (run from archive directory)](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/2504/#Comment_2504 "Script to print all tags from .txt files (run from archive directory)") by Will, a.k.a. *Create a "Tag Cloud" note*.
- [Create note that adds details to tag](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/7440/#Comment_7440) by @Will.
    - Another approach in The Archive could be to create a note with the tag as the filename. When you search for the tag `#zettelkasten`, the file `#zettelkasten.txt` will be presented to you automatically as a sort of hub note.
- [Generate a statistics dashboard](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/786/zettelkasten-statistics) by @Will.
- [Visualize network of selected notes via graphviz](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/670/visualising-links-between-zettels-with-keyboard-maestro-and-graphviz) by @Vinho.
- [Create nested list from connections of selected notes](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/630/feature-request-outliner-view-of-a-zettel-and-its-children) by @Vinho.
- [Create & update note backlink back-matter](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/4413/#Comment_4413) by @piotr. Uses Andy Matuschak's "note janitor" script [we wrote about before](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/670/visualising-links-between-zettels-with-keyboard-maestro-and-graphviz).

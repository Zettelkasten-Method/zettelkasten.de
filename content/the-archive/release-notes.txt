# The Archive: Release Notes

"Beta" releases are available to you as soon as you switch to the "Cutting Edge" update channel in _The Archive_'s preferences.

## v1.8.2 (Beta: 2025-02-07; Public: 2025-02-16)

- **Fixed:** Scroll position and selection restoration when viewing notes now works correctly again.
- **Changed:** Marked preview and word count (in the status bar) update more snappily.

## v1.8.1 (Beta: 2025-01-14; Final: 2025-01-20)

- **New:** Plug-ins can access the `tags` property of note objects. This property was reserved previously, but now is populated with actual data.
- **Fixed:** Some [URL Scheme-based preference changes](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#hidden-preferences) did not work.
- **Changed:** Updated the internal MultiMarkdown highlighter.

## v1.8.0 Beta (2024-11-19)

- **New:** The all new plug-in system has arrived! You can use the Plug-In Developer Console to tinker with script ideas, export `.thearchiveplugin` bundles, and share these with others. This is huge, so [find out more on our plug-in page!](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/plug-ins/)
- **Changed:** Media (or attachment) management treats existing sub-directories properly. Previously, they were ignored, only the files in considered.
- **Fixed:** Undoing/redoing file operations is bound to each window or tab. Previously, these operations were tied to the first or initial window. This had the unintended side-effect that closing this window would clear undoable operations from other windows or tabs.
- **Fixed:** Moving lines up/down was broken in the previous update, and its correct behavior is now restored for multi-line paragraphs.
- **Fixed:** Trying to create notes with relative paths like `../../` in their name now won't try to actually reach that parent folder anymore.
- **Fixed:** File encoding issue where a `ZERO WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE (ZWNBSP)` character nobody would ever actually use in that position with intent was producing a rendering error.

## v1.7.16 (2024-07-19)

- **Fixed:** Crash introduced in the previous beta (v1.7.15) when using formatting shortcuts in documents after non-ASCII characters.
- **Fixed:** Menu items like "Switch Archives" work without an editor window, too. Previously, they were disabled unless you saw an app window.
- **New:** User-facing option to change the new smart formatting behavior in the "Format" menu and the "Editing" app preference pane.
- **New:** Clear search highlights in a note from _View ▶ Clear Highlighted Terms_.

## v1.7.15 Beta (2024-07-11)

- **New:** More Markdown commands now have entries in the "Format" menu so you can [assign custom shortcuts](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#how-can-i-assign-custom-shortcuts).
    - Inline code: <kbd>Cmd+Ctrl+C</kbd>
    - Code blocks: <kbd>Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+C</kbd>
    - Link (insert or remove): <kbd>Cmd+K</kbd>
- **New:** Smart re-emphasis. Existing emphasis in the selection will be removed before wrapping the result in the desired markup.
- **New:** "Reveal in Finder" added to right-click menu on image paths.
- **New:** [Hidden preference](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#hidden-preferences) to change the pasted image filename pattern via `thearchive://preference/pastedImageFilename/`. Accepts [Unicode Technical Standard #35 format](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-31/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns).
- **New:** [Hidden preference](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#hidden-preferences) ot change the Zettel identifier date format via `thearchive://preference/identifierDateFormat/`. Accepts [Unicode Technical Standard #35 format](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-31/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns).
- **Changed:** Markup shortcuts operate on selected or adjacent words. This should "do what you mean" more often.
- **Improved:** Typing performance in long documents (especially when typing auto-pairing characters).
- **Improved:** Search responsiveness in situations of limited resources (e.g. during a video call on relatively slow Intel MacBook Airs).
- **Fixed:** Moving lines up/down with a shortcut scrolls the new line location into view if Typrwriter Mode is disabled, so you can actually see where you're moving the line.

## v1.7.14 (2023-12-29)

- **Fixed:** macOS Sonoma display glitches (e.g. invisible sidebar).
- **Fixed:** Markdown rendering issue that crashed the app.

## v1.7.13 (2023-12-28)

(This version introduces problems on Sonoma and was retracted.)

- **Fixed:** Crash during startup on High Sierra.
- **Changed:** Navigate Back/Forward removed from "Note" menu (already in Navigate menu).

## v1.7.12 (2023-06-19)

- **Fixed:** Restoration of scroll position in long notes. (Thanks two tons to Paul Troop for live-debugging the issue with me for 90 minutes straight!)

## v1.7.11 (2023-02-18)

Please note The Archive now requires macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or newer for technical reasons.

- **Fixed:** Trashing a note in The Archive from a folder that's managed by third party sync solutions (i.e. not iCloud) could hang the app. This affected Dropbox users with the recent Dropbox updates.
- **Changed:** Removed animation in the preferences window that began to look quite odd in recent macOS versions.
- **Changed:** Some performance improvements that affect note editing.

## v1.7.10 Beta (2022-12-16)

- **New:** Drag and drop from chat apps and web browsers imports images.
- **New:** When you copy images from the web browser and paste them into The Archive, the correct file type will be used, instead of a generic TIFF image.
- **New:** When you copy images files, from Mail or Messages or Finder, and paste them into The Archive, they'll be imported similar to drag and drop as a copy.
- **New:** Using the Page Up/Page Down keys in the Omnibar scrolls the search results.
- **New:** Cmd-W when opening external editors closes the floating filter.
- **Fixed:** A cause of data loss where the wrong file was replaced with the currently visited note.
- **Fixed:** Issue with license codes now appearing invalid: previously, they could contain spaces in the middle, which are hard to spot, and that became illegal a couple updates ago. Now The Archive cleans these up for you.
- **Fixed:** Cmd-Backspace when renaming a note will delete to the beginning of the text field instead of delete the note.
- **Fixed:** Page Up/Page Down keys scroll the search results lists when it has focus.

## v1.7.9 Beta (2022-09-27)

- **New:** You can paste images from the clipboard. The Archive creates an image from the clipboard contents and imports it into your resources directory, aka the "media" folder. For example, this works with screenshots via the system-wide ⌃⇧⌘4 shortcut, and with copied images from web browsers.
- **New:** Create note from right-click menu in the search results list.
- **New:** Console log viewer in the "Debug" menu, available with the `debugMode` [hidden preference](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#hidden-preferences).
- **Fixed:** Renaming a note from the right-click menu works without a selection, treating the clicked note as the to-be-renamed one.
- **Fixed:** Special characters and emoji (that aren't part of your actual font used for typing) were prone to temporarily vanish sometimes.

## v1.7.8 Beta (2022-09-19)

- **New:** Open Link in New Tab/New Window are now part of the context menu when you click on a link.
- **New:** Access to new "Debug" menus with the `debugMode` [hidden preference](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help/#hidden-preferences).
- **Changed:** Removed the extra 'padding' of the active area around the divider between search result list and note editor. Changing it is now a hidden preference.
- **Fixed:** Suppressing the note deletion confirmation dialog didn't persist across app launches.
- **Fixed:** Renaming attachments could crash an internal macOS editor component.
- **Fixed:** Renaming attachments (like images) with a `file://` URL scheme didn't retain the scheme part after the rename was completed, and instead reverted to regular paths.
- **Fixed:** When allowing the theme to override fonts with relative/fractional font sizes for some elements, the relative size was applied twice for inline code `...` and wikilinks inside lists.

## v1.7.7 (2022-03-16)

- **New:** You can right-click a file path to rename the file -- enabled for managed resources, like images in your media folder.
- **New:** When all windows are closed, the Saved Searches shortcuts will open a new window and search there directly, just like Cmd+L would bring up a new window, if needed.
- **Fixed:** Invoking Saved Searches via shortcuts or the main menu doesn't trigger a search in *all* windows/tabs, just the frontmost one.
- **Fixed:** New files are created with a Zettel ID timestamp by default again if you never changed this setting manually.
- **Changed:** Taking pictures with the webcam: some visual overhauls for contrast and to better hit the "take picture" button.

## v1.7.6 (2022-02-23)

- **New:** Drag & drop of image files into the app will use relative paths if the media directory is inside your notes' directory. Otherwise, the app asks if and how you want to import the file into your managed resources directory.
- **New:** "Storage" settings pane to group where notes are stored and how resources are managed and imported.
- **New:** Camera capture (webcam tool) allows to quickly retake pictures without having to cancel.
- **Changed:** The media subfolder setting now also accepts absolute paths and shows a preview/reveal button.
- **Changed:** Performance improvements and less memory usage with multiple tabs/windows open at the same time.
- **Changed:** Right-click menu offers default shortcuts to interact with selected note(s).
- **Fixed:** Camera capture (webcam tool) window buttons looked goofy on more recent macOS versions. Fixed their layout and their borders being cropped off. The preview also resizes when you resize the window now.
- **Fixed:** Recognition of image files in macOS Catalina and earlier.

## v1.7.5 (2021-11-17)

First non-Cutting Edge release since v1.6.3. Contains all changes since then. For Cutting Edge updates, this version introduces the following changes:

- **Fixed:** Clicking of inline image paths that contain subdirectories.
- **Fixed:** Finding the end of a `#hashtag` when it ends with special characters.
- **Changed:** Inline image paths are more forgiving: you can mix and match percent-encoded paths with `file://` URLs.

## v1.7.4 Beta (2021-11-03)

- **Fixed:** Background colors of e.g. inline code right after a list item's bullet stretched leftwards up to the bullet character. That's no longer an issue.
- **Changed:** Various speed improvements of the Markdown rendering engine, especially in larger documents.

## v1.7.3 Beta (2021-10-07)

- **Fixed:** The last hashtag in a line wasn't clickable when it was followed by a space.
- **Fixed:** Metadata block recognizion, both for YAML headers and MultiMarkdown headers.

## v1.7.2 Beta (2021-10-01)

Mostly improvements for the MultiMarkdown accuracy and compatibility.

- **Fixed:** `matchOrCreate` URL scheme action correctly uses the given title again.
- **Fixed:** Huge performance bottleneck related to a macOS Touch Bar API problem that was affecting large document performance when typing or moving the insertion point.
- **Fixed:** Visual multi-line indentation using real tabs at 2 and 4 spaces width.
- **Fixed:** HTML comment range colors now apply correctly to the whole range including the opening `<!--` and closing `-->` syntax elements when the comment spans multiple lines.
- **Fixed:** Wikilinks and hashtags are detected inside multi-line comments.
- **Fixed:** Wikilinks after an exclamation mark like `this![[...]]` were recognized as image syntax (`![...]`). Now the wikilinks take precedence.
- **Changed:** Visual indentation of multi-line paragraphs now applies to *any* line, not just list items, so you can soft-wrap and indent code blocks and regular paragraphs as well.

## v1.7.1 Beta (2021-08-26)

- **Fixed:** Wiki link detection in MultiMarkdown front-matter.
- **Fixed:** "Problems during archive initialization" is presented only once, and after you dismiss the alert, the same errors will not bug you again.
- **Fixed:** Opening a note in The Archive for the first time could auto-select text sometimes. Now looking at a note for the first time appropriately starts at the beginning of the document.
- **Fixed:** Restoring the old scroll position of a note now works reliably.
- **Fixed:** Opening links in new window or new tab with the new editor.
- **Fixed:** Auto-linking of URLs: clean-up of broken links fixed, and while links lists used to work while you type, once you changed the list layout, the clickable link would vanish.
- **Fixed:** While we don't allow inline images to be displayed in some cases, the paths are now always clickable. Now also skips image syntax inside comments.
- **Fixed:** Character composition using accents, or using Japanese or Chinese input methods, used to be interruptible by external file changes.
- **Changed:** When a file is removed before The Archive could read it for the first time, this will not raise an error anymore and is just going to be ignored. This improved compatibility with apps like Typora that implement non-standard file save operations.
- **Changed/Fixed:** Links and other URLs inside code blocks and inline code spans aren't recognized as clickable anymore.
- **Changed:** Definition list items that span multiple lines indent all lines visually like all the other lists.
- **New:** Hidden preference `isRestoringScrollPosition` to disable restoration of note scroll positions.
- **New:** If you want to use real tabs, you can customize their width to 2 or 4 characters (n-width).
- **New:** Pressing the tab key inside a list always indents the current line.

Please report any Markdown styling you didn't expect to look the way it does to support via the app's Help menu.

## v1.7.0 Beta (2021-08-04)

- **New:** Complete replacement of the note editor component, backed by the super fast MultiMarkdown parser. This means everything is faster now. Typing, selecting notes, resizing the sidebars -- just about everything where the editor is involved. Also some weird syntax edge cases are now resolved.
- Known issue: Restoring the last scroll position when re-visiting of a note a bit flaky. The issue does not appear when you click on notes in the results list. It only appears when you use the arrow keys. (Fixed in v1.7.1)

## v1.6.3 (2021-05-16)

- **Fixed:** The Archive tells macOS about its file changes in a way that should play better with other so-called "document-based" apps. They now coordinate reading and writing internally. (Example: iA Writer, TableFlip)
- **Fixed:** When you used the shortcuts to outdent a line or decreate the quotation level and the insertion point was at the very beginning of the line, it was nudged to the left, turning up in another line of the note effectively.
- **Changed:** The _External Editor_ picker window now looks better, especially on Big Sur.
- **Changed:** The app preferences now have icons in the toolbar. It seems to be the way forward with macOS and was reinforced with Big Sur, so we adopt this convention, too.
- **Changed:** The Saved Searches icon sidebar now matches the look of the preferences when you have set "Display Large Icons". These measure 32x32 pixels. The smaller variant is now half the size, 16x16. (Used to be 24x24 which didn't scale well.)

## v1.6.2 (2021-04-13)

- **New:** Move line or selection up and down added, with default shortcuts.
- **New:** Open link in new window, instead of new tab, on macOS 10.12 or newer. Works with <kbd>Cmd-Shift-Click</kbd>, or <kbd>Cmd-Ctrl-Shift-Return</kbd> (a variant of "Open Links at Selection").
- **Changed:** Groups actions in a "Navigate" menu that move around in a note and change the note selection.
- **Fixed:** Saved Searches shortcuts in the main menu including the Option key used to display special characters instead of the Latin character on the keyboard.
- **Fixed:** Dark mode colors of shortcut fields are readable again.
- **Fixed:** Autosaving when closing windows/tabs.

## v1.6.1 (2021-03-16)

- **New:** Themes now support setting fonts without specifying a size. You can specify `"font": {"name": "Menlo"}` and thus the font family is replaced, inheriting the user's font size choice. This makes using multiple fonts at the same, user-customizable scale easier.
- **New:** Themes support relative font size changes, e.g. `"font": {"name": "Arial", "relativeSize": "200%"}`, e.g. to make headings bigger. Line height isn't increases proportionally, though, so huge changes here won't look good for now.
- **Fixed:** Crashing bug when trying to delete an already deleted file a second time.

## v1.6.0 Final Release (2021-02-22)

The public release of all the v1.6.0 changes listed below. If you're not on the "Cutting Edge" update channel, you'll most notable receive: the image preview; way better file sync service compatibility; a dozen fixes for minor inconveniences.

- **Changed:** HTML link encoded spaces like `%20` work in image previews as well. -- Here's a tip: If you can, consider using dashes instead of spaces for filenames of resources. Dashes are way more robust to work with in general given the variety of Markdown tools available.
- **Changed:** The Welcome notes now ship with a sample image.
- **Fixed:** Issue on Big Sur where the Saved Searches list in the app's preferences was displayed incorrectly.

## v1.6.0 Release Candidate 2 (2021-02-14)

- **Fixed:** Hitting ESC to show all notes doesn't reset the editor in other tabs anymore. Until now, ESC would show all notes in the current tab and deselect the note; but then also globally deselected the note in all other tabs, too.
- **Fixed:** Deleting the search string (e.g. with backspace) until there's nothing left used to leave the last selected note selected visually in the search results list, without actually showing the note.
- **Fixed:** Making changes to the note via spell checking/auto-correction didn't persist because it didn't mark the note as needing to be saved.

## v1.6.0 Release Candidate 1 (2021-02-06)

- **New:** Inline image preview. Enable or disable from the "Editing" preferencs or the "View" main menu.
- **New:** When trying to access a file that was deleted, e.g. via the history navigation, display an information notice in the middle of the screen instead of (a) trying to fetch the note from the cache or (b) when the note isn't cached, fail.
- **Changed:** Inline image links used to produce clickable links only for empty labels, or single-word labels. It now works with spaces in the label part, too, `![like so](pic.jpg)`.
- **Changed:** Surrounding text with parens or emphasis characters is disabled when you select an image preview. Instead of surrounding, it replaces the selection with the character. (This is a temporary technical limitation.)
- **Changed:** Improved performance and display of the note list on Big Sur.
- **Changed:** Undoing external file changes is now labeled: you'll see "Undo External Change" in the Edit menu for these.
- **Changed:** Attempting to delete a note that isn't found on disk anymore does not display an error aymore. Since the file is gone, and that's the user's intention, it removes the missing note from the note list.
- **Changed:** When you send log files, the files will be revealed in Finder just in case your email application doesn't automatically attach them.
- **Fixed:** The Archive relinquishes "ownership" of a note you've edited a bit more to avoid Dropbox/iCloud/... sync conflicts when you edit the same note on 2+ computers. Previously, 2 instances of The Archive could have started to react to synced file changes by reading the changes and then saving file metadata (like cursor position in the note) again, thus producing an update for the other end, ad infinitum.

## v1.5.9 (2020-11-09)

The "release" version bundles the following changes and those from v1.5.8 and v1.5.7, which were only available as a "cutting edge" release:

- **Fixed:** Removes the document icon from the title bar that was introduced when exposing the current note's URL to AppleScript.
- **Changed:** Following a link via keyboard shortcut takes links right before and right after your insertion point into account, so you can type a link, and with the cursor right after it, still open it.
- **Changed:** A default value of the status bar visibility wasn't set on first launch; now the default is "true" for initial discovery. If you ever manually hid the status bar, your setting will be respected.

## v1.5.8 Beta (2020-10-30)

- **Fixed:** In some cases, Cmd-Click would search first, then open the tab. Now it opens a new tab first.
- **Fixed:** Resizing the window doesn't shrink the editor anymore so much that it can be hidden.
- **Changed:** Add app guide info for the navigation buttons and status bar, and explain shortcuts a bit more.
- **Changed:** The new link-related shortcuts are now <kbd>Cmd-Ctrl-J</kbd> to jump, and <kbd>Cmd-Ctrl-Return</kbd> to open.
- **New:** Adds "Jump to Previous Link" (<kbd>Cmd-Ctrl-Opt-J</kbd>).
- **New:** Adds "Open Link in New Tab" (<kbd>Cmd-Ctrl-Opt-Return</kbd>).
- **New:** Support Marked 2's "Streaming Preview" with relative paths to links and images.

## v1.5.7 Beta (2020-10-21)

- **Fixed:** Icon selection for Saved Searches on macOS 10.11 El Capitan didn't display the built-in icons.
- **Fixed:** Sidebar widths (and visibility settings) are remembered next time you start the app.
- **Fixed:** The Quick Entry Helper doesn't error-out when you try to create a file that has way too many characters for macOS to handle, resulting in loss of data of the form. You can now fix the problem and try again.
- **Fixed:** When you hit Enter in the Omnibar and a new file would be created, you'll get a warning that the file name is too long instead of a file creation error.
- **Fixed:** Visibility of the Quick Entry helper in dark mode.
- **Changed:** When you try to rename a note and exceed macOS's file name length limit, you geta visual feedback while you type and the app won't let you commit the name change. This also prevents "could not rename" errors from popping up.
- **Changed:** The Quick Entry Helper shows the auto-generated file name based on IDs in the form, instead of generating a surprise ID after you click "Create".
- **New:** Command-click `[[wiki links]]` and `#hashtags`  to open the result in a new tab.
- **New:** Follow links at the cursor position with a keyboard shortcut.
- **New:** Jump to the next link in the text with a keyboard shortcut. This feature tastes best when combined with the new "follow link" command.

## v1.5.6 (2020-08-07)

- **Fixed:** Changing the selected note from the menu via keyboard shortcuts used to keep the last note open if the changes were not saved, yet. Changes are now properly saved before the selection is changed to fix this.
- **Changed:** When no external editor is set but the Cmd+E shortcut is used, instructions to add an editor are now displayed.

## v1.5.5 (2020-07-17)

- **Fixed:** On macOS 10.11 (El Capitan), the "External Editors" table heading displayed a reddish border.
- **Changed:** The Saved Searches editor in the preferences now has a more native preferences look to it.
- **Changed:** The built-in black and white "The Archive" icon for Saved Searches renders more sharply now. You have to re-select it in the Saved Searches editor for the changes to take effect.
- **Changed:** Adjust the size and position of the "(x)" button in the banner that explains you don't need to manually save your notes to match the Omnibar.
- **Changed:** Display crash reporter windows on top of the main window (so it is not accidentally obstructed on launch).
- **Changed:** Make `thearchive://` URL scheme action ignore the case, so `matchOrCreate` and `matchorcreate` or even `MatCHorCrEaTe` will work.
- **New:** Sort notes by their creation date.
- **New:** The currently active note sort order is highlighted in the _View > Sort By_ menu.
- **New:** Support for setting hidden preferences: app settings that didn't make it to the preference panes. Use `thearchive://preference/PREFERENCENAME/set/NEWVALUE/` and `thearchive://preference/PREFERENCENAME/delete` to change these. A list of customizable entires is in [the online help](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/help)

## v1.5.4 Beta (2020-06-27)

- **Changed:** Improved the Omnibar's instructions when it's empty. It now shows keyboard navigation shortcuts.
- **Changed:** Reorganized the app preferences. Updates and license info are now under "General", and file settings under "Advanced". The editor for saved searches is now part of the preferences, too.
- **Changed:** Adjusted white space in the notes list so it looks less cramped, especially in full screen mode.
- **New:** Add "Select Previous" and "Select Next" to _Note_ main menu so you can bind shortcuts to change the selected note without having to focus the Omnibar.
- **New:** Support for activity to be tracked by Timing 2.

## v1.5.3 (2020-06-06)

- **Fixed:** _Edit > Select Line_ does now correctly activate when the focus is inside the editor.
- **Fixed:** Using the editor's find bar and then searching for something in the Omnibar that matches a note and displays it in the editor will no longer auto-focus the editor once the match was found: you can continue to type in the Omnibar like usual.
- **Fixed:** The editor's find bar can no longer be invoked with Cmd+F right after app launch when the editor is invisible.
- **Changed:** The word count of the currently displayed note updates while you type, not only when you pause.
- **Changed:** The "External Editors" window will close itself when you click outside, and it always appears on top of the main window as a modal window.
- **Changed:** The _Theme Updater..._ menu item is now in the _The Archive_ main menu.
- **Changed:** Rotating log files are not put into the trash anymore, but removed directly. This should help all of you who like to keep their Finder trash clean.
- **New:** Marked 2 Streaming Preview: toggle it from the _Note_ main menu or from the Advanced preferences. (Off by default.)

## v1.5.2 (2020-03-25)

- **Fixed:** The editor did prevent all shortcuts with the command key and "S" to work.
- **Changed:** Show a notification banner when you try to manually save very often.

## v1.5.1 Beta (2020-03-21)

- **Fixed:** Sort order of external editors.
- **Fixed:** Typo in "welcome" notes.
- **Fixed:** When clicking the Dock icon, open a new window on macOS 10.12+ if necessary.
- **Changed:** Hitting the "Save" shortcut <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> doesn't beep anymore.
- **Changed:** The bring-to-front hotkey is now a toggle. Use it once to activate the app and bring it to front; use it again to hide it.

## v1.5.0 Beta (2020-03-16)

- **Changed:** Reorganized preference pane contents into groups. Saved Searches icon size is now under the "Appearance" tab.
- **New:** Support for multiple External Editors.

## v1.4.7 (2020-02-01)

- **Fixed:** Crash when outdenting and undoing outdents at the very end of the document.
- **Fixed:** Save changes after removing emphasis. Removing emphasis from selected text via the shortcuts <kbd>Cmd+B</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+I</kbd> used to not mark the document as "dirty" and in need of being saved to disk; it now does.
- **Fixed:** Undoing the deletion of an emphasis character wrongly did insert a closing pair, as if you just typed it manually.
- **Fixed:** Button contrast of the guide/tutorial overlay was broken in light mode for recent Mojave updates and also Catalina.
- **New:** Status bar at the bottom of the window that shows the word count of the currently selected note. You have to enable it manually from _View_&nbsp;>&nbsp;_Show Status Bar_. We don't want to clutter the default UI for you all.

## v1.4.6 (2019-12-07)

- **Fixed:** Occasional error reading note contents when navigating back in history after renaming a note.
- **Changed:** Renaming a note now alters all known history. If you rename `A` to `B`, all occurrences of `A` will be replaced with `B` in the history. This way, you will not have to remember which note was renamed to what, when you encounter an outdated note filename.

## v1.4.5 (2019-11-07)

- **Fixed:** Another crashing bug when you close a window after using the system's <kbd>Cmd-F</kbd> search facility.
- **Fixed:** Regression to a crash when changing the Quick Entry Helper shortcuts.

## v1.4.3 Beta (2019-11-05)

- **Fixed:** A crashing bug when closing tabs in Catalina.

## v1.4.2 (2019-08-21)

- **Fixed:** Crash when renaming notes after editing on some devices.

## v1.4.1 (2019-08-10)

- **Fixed:** Crashing bug when you create an empty note from the Omnibar, i.e. clear all Omnibar contents and then hit enter.
- **Fixed:** Renaming a note changes text color during editing. You had to start to rename a note, then switch to another app, then back again; if you typed afterwards, the new text would be drawn in the color of the current theme's result list text color.

## v1.4.0 (2019-08-07)

Introduces multiple windows and tabs.

Changes since v1.3.1:

- **Fixed:** Using `thearchive://` URL scheme actions while the app doesn't run works now. Previously, the app would open but the action didn't execute, now it will.
- **Fixed:** Crash on some devices on external file changes. This was due to concurrent read _and_ write access to the search index.
- **Fixed:** Confirming a rename with the return key did not focus the result list again so that keyboard up/down navigation would not work.
- **Fixed:** When the Omnibar contains more text than it can fit, it smoothly scrolls when you navigate past the edges e.g. with the arrow keys.
- **Fixed:** When you selected multiple notes and hit Esc, the Omnibar would clear but no search was triggered. As a side-effect, hitting Esc multiple times in a row now effectively reloads the search.
- **Changed:** Reduced size of the app by ~10 MiB and improved performance.
- **New:** Ability to have multiple _workspaces_. These would be rendered as tabs on modern macOS versions by default. Pre-macOS 10.12, you'll see multiple windows instead.
- **New:** Added an [Internet Access Policy](https://obdev.at/iap/) so you get info about when and why the app is establishing a network connection to download updates.
- **New:** Added an automatic crash reporter to help you submit crashes.


## v1.3.4 Beta (2019-07-31)

- **Fixed:** When you selected multiple notes and hit Esc, the Omnibar would clear but no search was triggered. As a side-effect, hitting Esc multiple times in a row now effectively reloads the search.
- **Fixed:** Hitting Esc used to set an empty note selection twice in a row, which is now fixed. This should not have impacted perceivable performance at all for anyone, but is still an improvement in principle.
- **Fixed:** When the Omnibar contains more text than it can fit, it smoothly scrolls when you navigate past the edges e.g. with the arrow keys.
- **Fixed:** Confirming a rename with the return key did not focus the result list again so that keyboard up/down navigation would not work.
- **Changed:** User interface adjustments to look better with the tab bar visible.

## v1.3.3 Beta (2019-07-29)

- **New:** Ability to have multiple _workspaces_. These would be rendered as tabs on modern macOS versions by default. Pre-macOS 10.12, you'll have multiple windows instead.

## v1.3.2 Beta (2019-07-15)

- **Changed:** Reduced size of the app by ~10 MiB.
- **Changed:** Improved performance and responsiveness of searches.

## v1.3.1 (2019-07-06)

- **Fixed:** Using `thearchive://` URL scheme actions while the app doesn't run works now. Previously, the app would open but the action didn't execute, now it will.
- **Fixed:** Crash on some devices on external file changes. This was due to concurrent read _and_ write access to the search index.
- **New:** Added an [Internet Access Policy](https://obdev.at/iap/) so you get info about when and why the app is establishing a network connection to download updates.
- **New:** Added an automatic crash reporter to help you submit crashes.


## v1.3.0 (2019-06-08)

Introducing a note navigation history you'll recognize from any web browser ever!

This is a compilation of all the important changes leading up to v1.3.0 since v1.1.10:

- **Fixed:** Error dialogs popping up when you externally delete the currently displayed note.
- **Fixed:** Trying to delete a note twice when you cancel the first confirmation request: I introduced a bug where the second try wasn't recognized as a new deletion attempt and got ignored completely.
- **Fixed:** In the _Saved Searches_ editor, the color of the search terms was black on blue and is now properly highlighted.
- **Fixed:** Dark theme setting is stored properly and doesn't fall back to "Tomorrow".
- **Fixed:** Clear search button in the Omnibar was obstructed and didn't work and sometimes didn't even display.
- **Fixed:** Graphics glitches on macOS 10.13.x in the Theme Updater window during the fade animations.
- **Fixed:** Hashtag recognition for non-English characters that rely on character connectors a lot.
- **Changed:** Improved performance. In some cases, updates to the search result list happen faster now.
- **Changed:** Renaming a note in your search result list that was actually removed from disk will restore the contents to the new location instead of showing an error dialog.
- **Changed:** Renaming a note inside the app does not affect modification date anymore.
- **New:** Back/forward navigation!
    * _The Archive_ now sports a history of displayed notes: you can navigate back and forward to get to previously displayed notes and back again.
    * Since the convention for indenting/outdenting text is <kbd>Cmd+]</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd+[</kbd> respectively, and since <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + arrow keys is used to jump around in text, the shortcut for navigation is <kbd>Cmd-Ctrl</kbd> + arrow keys like in some web browsers and e.g. Xcode.
    * You can Show/Hide the new Navigation Buttons (from the "View" menu).
    * Touch Bar buttons for the navigation controls.
    * You can resurrect notes from history! Navigate back to an earlier point in time, rename or edit a note, and it will be saved to disk.
- **New:** Global bring-to-front hotkey to search quickly from anywhere while the app is running.
- **New:** Save and restore the scroll position for each note. When you enable "Highlight search terms", the editor will still scroll to show the first match. This does get rid of weird situations like scrolling down in a long note, then selecting a short one, and ending up way down at the bottom of it, too.
- **New:** Inter-app-identification like it's the 80s: Added `ZkTA` as the shorthand app identifier. You probably cannot do much with it directly, but some 3rd party apps like spell-checkers may rely on this to perform their ... checking ... of spells.


## v1.3.0 Beta (2019-06-08)

- **Fixed:** Removing a note from within the app will make it recoverable when you navigate back in the history. Previously, this would work fine for external note deletions, but deletions from within the app were ignored. remove it from all history records. This prevents outdated historic search results producing "cannot read this note from disk" errors when you click on affected notes. There is no undoing of this effect to the history.
- **Fixed:** Hashtag recognition for non-English characters that rely on character connectors a lot.
- **Fixed:** When you remove a file externally and then delete the note from your cached search results, you no longer get an error that the file could not be found. The app proceeds with removing the search result.
- **Changed:** Renaming a note inside the app does not affect modification date anymore.

## v1.2.6 Beta (2019-05-17)

I changed some triggers and responses to external events, so please give this release a thorough beating!

- **Fixed:** Error dialog popping up when you externally delete the currently displayed note.
- **Fixed:** Errors when renaming notes you deleted externally.
- **Changed:** Renaming a note in your search result list that was actually removed from disk will restore the contents to the new location instead of showing an error dialog.
- **New:** On first launch, installs a Saved Search called "The Archive", searching for the demo notes via `#thearchive` to demo this feature. If you have the app installed already and see this in your update notices dialog, fear not, you won't be affected!

## v1.2.5 Beta (2019-05-07)

- **Fixed:** Launch bug from v1.2.4 Beta 1.

## v1.2.4 Beta (2019-05-04)

- **Fixed:** Graphics glitches on macOS 10.13.x in the Theme Updater window during the fade animations.
- **Fixed:** Renaming notes externally now updates the note result list again; the regression was introduced in v1.2.2b.
- **New:** Save and restore the scroll position for each note. When you enable "Highlight search terms", the editor will still scroll to show the first match. This does get rid of weird situations like scrolling down in a long note, then selecting a short one, and ending up way down at the bottom of it, too.

## v1.2.3 Beta (2019-04-20)

- **Fixed:** Clear search button in the Omnibar was obstructed and didn't work and sometimes didn't even display.
- **Fixed:** Dark theme setting is stored properly and doesn't fall back to "Tomorrow".
- **Fixed:** Trying to delete a note twice when you cancel the first confirmation request: I introduced a bug where the second try wasn't recognized as a new deletion attempt and got ignored completely.
- **Fixed:** In the _Saved Searches_ editor, the color of the search terms was black on blue and is now properly highlighted.
- **New:** Global bring-to-front hotkey to search quickly from anywhere while the app is running.

## v1.2.2 Beta (2019-03-30)

- **Fixed:** Regression introduced in v1.2.1 where the search results wouldn't update when you triggered a similar search multiple times (e.g. clicked on tags) or invoked Saved Searches.
- **Changed:** Improved performance. In some cases, updates to the search result list happen faster now.
- **New:** Touch Bar buttons for the navigation controls.

## v1.2.1 Beta (2019-03-24)

- **Fixed:** Navigating backwards into the past a lot resulted in forgetting how to get back to the future.
- **Fixed:** Error dialog when navigating back to a note that was deleted. Deleting a note that was selected according to your history records now results in the history entry being removed.
- **Fixed:** Similarly, no errors after renaming a note that was part of history anymore. Renaming a note results in rewriting affected history items. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.
- **New:** You can navigate back from a search that yields no results, and then forward again. (Previously, only displaying a note would be added to the navigation history, so if you typed without changing the displayed note, as far as the app was concerned, you still were at the last item in the history.)

## v1.2.0 Beta (2019-03-14)

- **New:** Back/forward navigation!
    * _The Archive_ now sports a history of displayed notes: you can navigate back and forward to get to previously displayed notes and back again.
    * Since the convention for indenting/outdenting text is <kbd>Cmd+]</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd+[</kbd> respectively, and since <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + arrow keys is used to jump around in text, the shortcut for navigation is <kbd>Cmd-Ctrl</kbd> + arrow keys like in some web browsers and e.g. Xcode.
    * You can Show/Hide the new Navigation Buttons (from the "View" menu).
- **New:** Inter-app-identification like it's the 80s: Added `ZkTA` as the shorthand app identifier. You probably cannot do much with it directly, but some 3rd party apps like spell-checkers may rely on this to perform their ... checking ... of spells.

## v1.1.11 (2019-03-09)

- **Fixed:** Temporary memory leak when switching archives.
- **Fixed:** Sort order when copying notes is maintained. Also, it's faster.
- **Changed:** When your drive's Finder Trash is broken or doesn't exist, the app then tries to removes instead of trash the file.
- **Changed:** Improves the undo/redo cycles of note creation and deletion so you don't get as many failure dialogs, e.g. when you sync your archive via Dropbox.
- **Changed:** Cleaned up and simplified a lot of the behind-the-scenes handling of most of what the app does. Speed increase is negligible, sadly :)

## v1.1.10 (2019-03-05)

- **Fixed:** "What's New" launch dialog is now Mojave dark-mode ready, and doesn't appear on first launch anymore, but only after you update.

## v1.1.8 (2019-02-07)

- **Fixed:** A couple of small memory leaks when you switch archives.
- **Changed:** Improved the overall performance of the app by making the main event pipeline faster.
- **Changed:** Selecting multiple notes empties the Omnibar. Previously, the title of one of the selected notes was still displayed in there, not corresponding to the fact you don't see an editor.
- **New:** The Omnibar displays a placeholder text of a light shade.

## v1.1.7 (2019-01-14)

- **Fixed:** Broken display of some preferences on High Sierra due to an Apple Bug that wasn't fixed back then, it seems.

## v1.1.6 (2019-01-09)

- **Fixed:** The new sidebar settings didn't adjust to large Saved Search icons.
- **Fixed:** Preferences window sizing and animation did wobble in the past.
- **New:** When you pick a font that is not at regular width or does not support bold, italic, or bold-italic, you are warned about the font's missing features.

## v1.1.5 (2019-01-07)

- **Fixed:** Crash when using the "Capture Image" function with the new security settings since Mojave.
- **Fixed:** Collapsing sidebars or making the app full-screen does not break text editor layout anymore.
- **Fixed:** The text field of renaming a note used black text on white background in dark mode. This is now reversed to fit the system standard.
- **Fixed:** Allowing/disallowing themes to change fonts takes effect immediately now.

## v1.1.4 (2018-12-28)

- **Fixed:** Various dark mode-related fixes, like translucent icons, non-adaptive buttons, and introducing nicer colors.
- **Fixed:** Changing colors or otherwise editing Saved Searches did progressively darken all custom tint colors until they turned black. (This was a fun bug, because it showed how saving colors in SRGB and restoring in a different color profile  could slowly deteriorate overall color appearances.)
- **New:** Dark Mode theme switches. Theme settings now also have a separate preference pane.

## v1.1.3 (2018-11-09)

- **Fixed:** Crash when changing Saved Search and Quick Entry shortcuts.
- **Fixed:** Mojave cutting-off preferences at the bottom.
- **New:** "Copy Link to Note" added to the Edit menu.

## v1.1.2 (2018-10-27)

- **Fixed:** Bug where editing note A and then selecting note B would overwrite the contents of B with A.
- **Changed:** Enabled Mojave App Notarization. Should now perform the first run even easier on Mojave.

## v1.1.1 (2018-09-25)

- **New:** Support for macOS 10.14 Mojave and its _Dark Mode_!

## v1.1.0 (2018-08-25)

New since Version 1.0.1:

- External changes to files in the archive are picked up and displayed live in the editor.
- Themes now also provide color settings for the sidebar.
- Themes can be updated from within the app.
- More intuitive behavior when browsing notes, not scrolling around when switching notes as much as before.
- Various small fixes and behavior tweaks, like: link highlight fixes; changes to the behavior of highlighted terms; more whitespace in the user interface.

A breakdown of changes since the last release:

### v1.1.0 (2018-08-25)

- **Fixed:** Creating a new note with <kbd>Cmd-N</kbd> before pending changes to the currently displayed note have been saved would not select and display the new note.
- **Fixed:** Wiki links with `[[...]]` do not span multiple lines anymore.
- **Fixed:** Changing Saved Search icon tint didn't work unless you changed the radio button selection.
- **New:** Display the sole note automatically when your search produces only 1 result. This is intended to treat e.g. pasting note titles into the Omnibar as an "Open" command.

### v1.0.11 (2018-08-04)

- **Fixed:** Saved Search icon changes show up in the sidebar immediately now.
- **Changed:** Do not jump to search terms for the best match but keep the cursor at the last insertion point: this way you can jump between notes using the search and continue where you left off.

### v1.0.10 (2018-07-19)

- **Fixed**: Searching in the Omnibar that produces a "match" (i.e. selects a note starting with the search string) would move focus to the editor after the 2nd character. Now you can search for more than 2 characters again.

### v1.0.9 (2018-07-19)

- **Fixed:** React properly to external file changes according to the [Basil 2x2 Matrix](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/1653/#Comment_1653).
- **Fixed:** Broken undo introduced in v1.0.8.
- **Fixed:** Display flickering introduced in v1.0.8.

### v1.0.8 (2018-07-16)

- **Fixed:** The big one: external changes are now getting through to the editor.
- **Fixed:** Remove line breaks when pasting into the Omnibar.
- **New:** Preview the theme's background color in the Saved Search icon editor so you can configure the colors more accurately.
- **New:** "What's New" info window on launch after significant updates (like this one).

### v1.0.7 (2018-06-15)

- **Fixed:** Updating themes did not work, now it does. Please update your themes, too!
- **Fixed:** When all you did after an autosave was to undo an indentation change, this wasn't considered to be needed to be saved and thus the change was lost.
- **Changed:** Increased padding around icons in the Saved Searches sidebar.
- **Changed:** Increased search result vertical whitespace.
- **Changed:** Broken themes will now produce an error message that can help theme developers debug their stuff.
- **New:** The format menu sports a "Quote" submenu with shortcuts to increase and decrease the quotation level.
- **New:** Themable sidebars and search result lists. Existing themes have been updated accordingly.
- **New:** Themes now offer a tasteful default Saved Search icon color so that you don't have to worry about finding a nice-looking color again when you switch themes.

### v1.0.6 (2018-05-09)

- **Fixed:** Avoid re-displaying the same note text, potentially reducing editor flickering during auto-saves.
- **Fixed:** Emails are now made clickable differently, which makes `message:` links to Mail.app's messages behave properly.
- **Fixed:** Formatting command shortcuts activate autosaving, too. (Previously, only typing did.)
- **Fixed:** Tab-indented lists are now styled correctly, including highlight of links in indented list items.
- **Fixed:** Markdown images on the same line as a reference-style link did highlight everything in between as part of the image markup.

### v1.0.5 (2018-05-08)

* **Fix:** Display new themes when available.
* **Fixed:** External file changes were consumed properly, but also triggered by _internal_ changes to a note. In some cases, this made the cursor move back to the old position.

### v1.0.4 (2018-04-26)

* **Fixed:** External file changes now affect the currently displayed note, too. This should prevent data loss when you switch between _The Archive_ and an external editor quickly and often. This should also get rid of error dialogs about conflicts when you rename, move, or delete the currently displayed note from the Finder.

### v1.0.3 (2018-04-23)

* **Fixed:** On High Sierra, opening the help menu prevents the app from accepting any further input if you don't close it by hovering over another main menu item. (I suspect this is because the "Search" box in the help menu doesn't give back focus to the window. See rdar://39374865) You can see the bug in action when you focus the Omnibar so it gets the blue focus outline, then click on the the Help menu item.  The blue outline should vanish. Now hover over the Window main menu. The outline should come back. That's when the window reacquires focus. That still doesn't happen when you just click out of the Help menu, but at least it's not blocking input anymore, either.
* **Changed:** Improve performance of complex term highlights.
* **Changed:** All built-in themes now support colored search term highlighting.
* **New:** Disable alternating result list background colors from the settings.
* **New:** An all-new theme updater that manages, well, theme updates.

### v1.0.2 (2018-04-11)

* **Fixed:** Selecting "Help > Registration" did show the right preference pane, but did not select the right toolbar item.
* **Changed:** Hashtag recognition supports a few more special characters.
* **New:** Boolean search expressions: `#emotion !#hate`, or the more verbose `#emotion AND NOT #hate` (case-sensitive!). The available operators are `AND` (or just space), `OR`, `NOT` (or prefixed with a `!`), and parentheses, like: `(#note OR #zettel) writing !publish`.
* **New:** Phrase search! `"the archive" OR #zettelkasten` will match, as expected, `the archive` but not `#thearchiveapp` or `the app`.

## v1.0.1 (2018-03-22)

* **Fixed:** The "Nothing Selected" editor placeholder now does not show a scroll bar when Typewriter Mode is enabled.
* **Fixed:** Setting a title in the Quick Entry window was ignored when you generate a Zettel ID.
* **Fixed:** Saved Search icon tint usage was not properly bound to the "Tint icon" checkbox state, allowing color changes when the checkbox was unticked.
* **Fixed:** The first change of a Saved Search icon with the "Tint Icon" checkbox unticked was ignored in the preview box.
* **Changed:** Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E will jump to the beginning and end of the Omnibar's text, respectively. Alt-Up/Alt-Down will do, too, now not remote-controlling the table anymore.
* **Changed:** Make the "Add Saved Search" button more prominent.
* **New:** Cmd-S saves Quick Entry note drafts, too.

## v1.0.0 (2018-03-14)

* **Fixed:** Using letter-based shortcuts for saved searches.
* **Fixed:** Quick Entry helper's shortcut assignment did not always store the key combo.
* **Fixed:** Prevent the Saved Searches editor window from entering fullscreen mode.
* **Changed:** Removed the hideous light drop shadow of icons in the Saved Search sidebar.
* **New:** Toggle-able Saved Search sidebar size (large & small).
* **New:** More default Saved Search icons.

## v0.5.7 (2018-03-07)

* **Fixed:** Switching themes did carry over editor colors if they are not set by the new theme, resulting in a weird mix of colors until you restart the app.
* **Fixed:** Renaming a note while the sidebar is hidden will show the sidebar first.
* **Fixed:** Show/Hide sidebar menu items did not update their text when the editor was focused, only from the Omnibar.
* **Changed:** Renamed the sort options from "descending" and "ascending" to something meaningful. I can never remember which is which, and I coded this myself. This is not a vocabulary test, it's a productivity-enhancing app, so out with the bourgeois terminology!
* **Changed:** Renamed "Search Results" to "Note List".
* **Changed:** Picking an external editor will show the `/Applications` directory by default.
* **New:** "Insert Zettel ID" (wired to <kbd>Cmd-U</kbd>) from the "Edit" menu will, well, insert a date-based Zettel ID. Totally not configurable at the moment.
* **New:** Setting to call new files "Untitled" as before, or use a Zettel ID that is still free to speed up verzettelling :)
* **New:** You can now close the main app window.

## v0.5.6 (2018-03-02)

* **Fixed:** The launch window now updates the previously known directory live instead of only after relaunch.
* **Fixed:** Crash on macOS 10.11 when showing the App Guide.

## v0.5.5 (2018-03-01)

* **Fixed:** External `/match/` URL invocation did not retain the supposed selection.
* **Changed:** Use segmented controls in the preferences. As the saying goes, a word says more than the same word with a stupid icon, or something.
* **Changed:** New demo notes.
* **Changed:** The directory selection window now can quickly open the last used location.
* **New:** 60-day trial instead of expiring beta. It is getting serious.
* **New:** Create and open an archive in `~/Documents/Notes (The Archive)` upon launch. No more boring "pick a directory" window unless you want to see it. Aaaand you probably have to, because as I mentioned above, launching this version will change your active archive directory once. :)

With this update, all you helpful beta testers are now immortalized in the "About" window's text. Thank you very much for helping us make the app better!

## v0.5.4 (2018-02-19)

* **Fixed:** A few regressions introduced in v0.5.1: there was a speed bump when ⌘A selecting lots of notes; and renaming the note didn't reflect the name change in the Omnibar.
* **Fixed:** Starting to rename a note now scrolls the list until its row is visible so you know what and where you are typing.
* **Changed:** Tabbing and back-tabbing during and after editing a note title. Should now be a bit smoother.

## v0.5.3 (2018-02-16)

* **Fixed:** Tackles the crash that a lot more people have experienced since my last attempt at fixing it :)

## v0.5.2 (2018-02-14)

* **Fixed:** Renaming a note with an active search did deselect it in the results.
* **Fixed:** Tweaked a bit of code to _maybe_ prevent a rare crash that nobody but Sascha ever triggered so far.

## v0.5.1 (2018-02-13)

* **Fixed:** Actions from the "Note" menu that depend on a selection in the results list are now disabled when you are editing a note that is not part of the results list anymore, for example after changing the search.
* **Fixed:** When creating a note from the Omnibar, the editor did scroll down to keep the first line of text at the top, ignoring the top editor insets.
* **Fixed:** Forgot to insert a "points" unit label in the "Editing" preferences after the search result size.

## v0.5.0 (2018-02-09)

**Heads up!** When you update, your old filters will be gone. Please take note of your settings before updating and refer to the forum for info about the migration.

* **Fix:** When the Saved Searches editor is open but in the background, "Edit Saved Searches" now brings it back to front properly.
* **Fix:** Closing the find bar gives focus back to the note editor.
* **Changed:** Revamped the launch window a bit.
* **New:** Added "Create Demo Archive" to the launch window (access it by using "Switch Archives..." from the app menu).
* **New:** Added "Create Demo Notes..." to add the demo notes into your current archive if you happen to need an interactive guide.
* **New:** Added "Explain Interface" help menu item to, well, explain the user interface for less tech-savvy newcomers.
* **New:** You can assign custom shortcuts to saved searches.
* **New:** You can drag to reorder saved searches in the dedicated editor window.

If you want to propose changes to the demo notes, check out the forums and our public GitHub repository: <https://github.com/Zettelkasten-Method/The-Archive-Demo-Notes>

Finally, after 3 months of relative silence, _The Archive_ spawned new open source libraries! I published the UI explanation overlays as [`AppGuideOverlay`](https://github.com/CleanCocoa/AppGuideOverlay) And to animate the cutouts, I created [`LoopingAnimation`](https://github.com/CleanCocoa/LoopingAnimation). This produces a total of 8 published libraries for this app so far, which makes me really happy.

## v0.4.26 (2018-01-20)

* **Fix:** The reset-button for external editors does not appear when the external editor was already reset to "System Default".
* **Fix:** Clicking `[[WikiLinks]]` did not select the best match for you in the list. _Again_.
* **Fix:** Clicking `#hashtags` resulted in lost focus, impeding keyboard control; now the Omnibar has focus so you can continue to keyboard-control the app.
* **Changed:** Remove print-related, non-functional menu items.
* **Changed:** Undo renaming note is now deactivated. This caused trouble in the past when the file system couldn't catch up undoing/redoing very quickly. Also, when do you rename a note and want to undo the change instead of correcting a mistake in practice?
* **New:** Custom icons for the preferences tabs.

## v0.4.25 (2018-01-19)

* **Fix:** Issue when holding down the arrow keys for a while to move around in the results list. The note you select next wouldn't display.
* **Fix:** Text drawing issue when pushing the last line of text down by adding empty lines above it. (`rdar://36650289`)

## v0.4.24 (2018-01-17)

* **Fix:** Lost focus after renaming a note; this prevented <kbd>⌘R</kbd> to work repeatedly.
* **Fix:** Tabbing around works more reliably, especially tabbing out of the note renaming text field back into the editor.
* **Fix:** Editing note A and clicking on note B did discard the click due to note A being saved. Now the desired selected note change works.
* **Fix:** Bug by Apple where deleting in the 2nd line of text drew the insertion point too far up. (`rdar://36581248`)
* **Changed:** Removed "Save..." from "Note" menu.
* **New:** Deleting a note from the list select an adjacent note automatically, preferring the one below, as long as the deletion was triggered for the currently selected note. It does not change selection when you right-click someplace else in the list.

## v0.4.23 (2018-01-14)

* **Fixed:** Searching for a single Emoji and then selecting a note displayed the note title in monospace inside the Omnibar.
* **Fixed:** "Rename" from the contextual menu works again.
* **Fixed:** Composable accent characters now do not replace selected text but surround it with their pairs, so that you can mark text as code or wrap in single quotation marks even though you use these keys to write `à` or `é` and similar.
* **Fixed:** Editing file extensions did not update the list of extensions to select the default extension from when you just clicked on the drop-down.
* **Changed:** Search for non-ASCII letters/characters should be resilient against encoding problems.
* **Changed:** Identical searches are not ignored anymore, so you can use a Saved Search shortcut multiple times in a row, e.g. to reload the results.

## v0.4.22 (2018-01-11)

* **Fixed:** Matching URLs was improved to exclude closing parens and other non-usual characters at the end of a web link.
* **Fixed:** You can now use backticks (\`) and quotation marks (`"` and `'`) to compose accented characters in keyboard layouts that support this, e.g. _U.S. International - PC_ or various European language ones. To get the auto-completion of character pairs in spite of the macOS accentuation mode, simply type space to type the character itself and trigger auto-pairing.
* **Changed:** Blockquote highlighter is more relaxed now to highlight empty lines with a `>` in a row, too.
* **Changed:** Clicking the same `[[WikiLink]]` will now refresh the search results (removing notes that no linker match the link contents) and take you to the best match again. In other words, clicking the same link more than once behave the same now, whereas it used to ignore consecutive clicks.
* **Changed:** Typing keys that are used to compose accented characters (usually drawn as the accent with a yellow background, waiting for completion) now does not trigger auto-pairing unless you abort the composition (with ESC or space, for example).
* **Changed:** Line width computation is now based on EN-width instead of EM-width (making it narrower for proportional width fonts). This is supposed to improve compatibility with [iA Writer Duospace Font](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts).

## v0.4.21 (2018-01-09)

* **Fixed:** Formatting shortcuts are functional again.
* **Fixed:** Selecting lots of notes is now way faster -- almost instantaneous, in fact. Even with 45k notes.

## v0.4.20 (2018-01-06)

* **Fixed:** Crash when indenting a line with a single character in it using <kbd>⌘]</kbd>.
* **Changed:** Dragging in the result list expands note selection instead of changing it.
* **New:** Multiple note selections in the results list (as usual, use command-click to pick some, or shift-click to select a range).
* **New:** Copy Link/Copy Links in result list's contextual menu.

## v0.4.19 (2017-12-23)

* **Fixed:** Indent/outdent selection works more reliably with mixed indentation characters (tabs and spaced).
* **New:** Configurable soft tabs (2 or 4 characters wide).
* **New:** Bold/italics shortcuts behave more clever: when the selected text is already emphasized, they try to de-emphasize the text. It you have no text selected, the shortcuts behave as if you type the `*` or `_` yourself, making them overwritable. Also, hitting the shortcut a second time inside the emphasis _closes_ it instead of opening a new emphasis pair.

## v0.4.18 (2017-12-20)

* **Fixed:** Another case where the blinking cursor was drawn too far to the top.
* **Fixed:** Do not ask for quitting confirmation when installing an update.
* **Fixed:** ESC inside the Omnibar properly deselects the note in the results list.
* **Fixed:** Reporting errors via email with ampersands `&` in error file names did truncate the message.
* **New:** Show warning when the selected theme file is broken.

## v0.4.17 (2017-12-19)

* **Fixed:** Insertion point is not drawn too far to the top anymore when you insert line breaks at the end of a note.
* **Changed:** Log files do now rotate daily (I don't know if there's a pun intended by the folks who came up with the terms). This means the app will keep 5 daily log files and clean up the rest. No more ever-growing multi-megabyte logs anymore, hooray!
* **New:** _Help ▶ Send Log Files_, in case you need to send your log files for debugging.

## v0.4.16 (2017-12-13)

Please delete existing themes to have _The Archive_ save new versions on launch.

### Overall app

* **Fixed:** Removed vertical resizing indicator (mouse cursor) at the bottom edge of the `Omnibar`.
* **Fixed:** Typewriter mode didn't "lock" on to the correct position for a while, which now seems to not cause problems anymore.
* **Fixed:** The currently selected match of highlighted search terms in the text editor did not look much different from all the others, making it hard to see where your selection is.
* **Fixed:** Clicking a `[[WikiLink]]` did not allow selecting the note from which you came right away. When the search produces only the link source itself, you weren't able to do anything with the search results.
* **Changed:** Switching fonts from a monospace to a flexible width font now shows an alert. If you switch from one flexible width font to another, you won't be nagged, though. (So you can adjust font sizes without problems, for example.)
* **New:** Safe-guarding dialog that asks before you quit in case you accidentally hit <kbd>⌘Q</kbd>, for example when you tab between applications.


### Markdown Highlighting

* **Fixed:** Emphasis flanking and flanked by parens and punctuation marks works correctly.
* **Fixed:** Emphasis of single characters.
* **Changed:** Markdown emphasis is now less strict: text will stay bold and italicized with a space character before the closing asterisks, so that emphasis remains visible while you type inside.
* **New:** Highlight MultiMarkdown-style footnote syntax, like `[^this-here]` for a reference footnote, and `[^The footnote text directly]` for Pandoc/MMD4 inline footnotes. Comes with a new theme rule, surprisingly called `footnote`.
* **New:** Themes now support an optional `unfocusedBackgroundColor` for `editor` ▶ `selection` (and `editor` ▶ `highlight`, but there it has no effect, yet) in order to customize the color of highlighted text when the window is not in the foreground or the text editor does not have focus. Previously, macOS used its default gray.

## v0.4.15 (2017-12-05)

* **Fixed:** Highlights headings and code blocks at the end of the document, even without trailing new lines.
* **Changed:** Double-clicking the font preview in the editor settings opens the font picker.
* **Changed:** Double-clicking an icon in the Saved Searches editor opens the icon picker popover.
* **New:** Picking a non-monospace font will show a notice in the settings.
* **New:** Added "Allows theme to override font" setting, which is enabled by default; disabling it will make multi-font themes uniform, retaining all color and the font replacement's style settings (bold, italic).

## v0.4.14 (2017-12-03)

* **Changed:** Experimental Markdown highlighter fix. Could also be more broken. Looks good to me so far, though.

## v0.4.13 (2017-12-02)

* **Fixed:** Files in subfolders are ignored and are not added to the index anymore.
* **New:** The find bar of the editor is closed when you switch notes.
* **New:** You can invoke "Find and Replace" for the editor from within the Omnibar and the results list. From anywhere, actually.

## v0.4.12 (2017-12-01)

* **Fixed:** Crash when changing font/font sizes a lot, then switch notes or type.
* **Fixed:** Unpredictable surprise crash when switching notes or type.

All of these weird crashes are not a good sign for the new Markdown highlighter, I have to admit.

## v0.4.11 (2017-11-30)

* **Fixed:** The font color of search term highlights did not disappear when you began editing a note, but now they do.
* **Fixed:** Carriage-returns instead of proper newlines now do not interfere with highlighting anymore. (Unlike advertised, this did not ship with v0.4.10.)
* **Changed:** Scroll results to top when typing in the Omnibar. (I did wonder why there are so little results after a search for old stuff more than once because I did not realize I could scroll up to reveal more. I have no clue where this assumption came from, but here it is, and it feels better now that it works accordingly.)

## v0.4.10 (2017-11-29)

* **Fixed:** Crash when browsing through long notes rapidly with search term highlighting enabled. As a side effect, highlighting performance should now be a bit better, too.

## v0.4.9 (2017-11-25)

* **Fixed:** Showing properly sized icon in the "Loading" window.
* **Fixed:** The "Loading" window now hides when you tab into another app and does not obstruct other applications.
* **Fixed:** Crash when working with blockquotes.
* **Fixed:** A few new layout glitches.
* **Fixed:** Fix Markdown issues with mixed newline characters, noticeable around headings, for example: Treat newline characters from Windows (carriage return) as lines terminators properly.
* **Fixed:** When sorting by modification date, selecting a note with the mouse did not work (because the re-sorting interfered); now it does!
* **Changed:** Improve performance of the Markdown highlighting slightly.
* **Changed:** Dragging around in the results list changes the active note; this is an unintended but welcome side effect of mentioned fix for selecting notes before re-sorting the result list.

## v0.4.8 (2017-11-24)

* **Fixed:** Text layout problem, resulting in crashes and overlapping characters.

## v0.4.7 (2017-11-23)

* **Fixed:** Changing the archive directory does not reset the sort order to "Title Ascending" anymore.
* **Fixed:** Changing the sort order with an active search now properly re-sorts the currently visible results.
* **Changed:** Atx-style headings are recognized without empty lines around them.
* **Changed:** Blockquotes do not require an empty space character after the `>` anymore.
* **New:** Sorting by modification date -- find the settings in the _View ▶ Sort By_ menu!
* **New:** Added "Reload Results" (<kbd>⌃R</kbd>) to the _Search_ menu for now to perform the same search again to update results.

## v0.4.6 (2017-11-21)

* **New:** "Disable Markdown" made its return to the Debug menu.
* **Fixed:** Reference-style link matching is not greedy anymore, that is not everything between a first and second link in the same paragraph will become blue.

## v0.4.5 (2017-11-18)

I bit the bullet and wrote a lightweight Markdown syntax highlighter completely from scratch. That's not to brag, but it's important to know that a lot might look differently now:

* **Fixed:** When switching active notes where one started with a link and the other didn't falsely styled the other one as a link, i.e. blue with underline.
* **Changed:** The syntax highlighter is different, so some files may produce different output than before.
* **New:** The Theme files have changed completely.

Also:

* **Fixed:** Typing 2 asterisks or underscores after a word now does not produce 3 anymore (the 2nd one was treated as an auto-completable new pair).
* **Changed:** Typing 2+ asterisks or underscores results in auto-completing the same amount of characters after the caret. Previously, typing `**` was interpreted as closing an emphasis; now it is treated as opening another bracketed asterisk pair. This is weird to put into words, but you'll see as soon as you type 2 asterisks. Try it!
* **Changed**: Allow even more special characters like `:` in hashtags.

## v0.4.4 (2017-11-10)

* **Fixed:** Auto-continuation of ordered lists wrapped to "1" after "10", but now correctly continues with "11".
* **Fixed:** "Copy title" from the contextual menu did not copy the title of the note you clicked on, but the currently visible note.
* **Fixed:** Many shortcuts and menu items related to the results list were disabled.

The mega-update I planned to release today will take some more time, sorry!

## v0.4.3 (2017-10-14)

* **Fixed:** Typing a quotation mark either before or (new!) right after a word does not insert a second one after the caret. Same for `*` and `_`.
* **Fixed:** Hitting Tab in the Quick Entry text field now switches focus to the title instead of indenting the line.
* **Fixed:** ⌥+Tab shortcuts and all formatting shortcuts now work in the Quick Entry text field.
* **Fixed:** "Toggle List" formatting did not recognize ordered list items with parens, like `1)`.
* **Changed:** When using "Select Line" (<kbd>⇧⌘L</kbd>) in a list once, it selects textual list contents excluding the list item; use the shortcut again to select the whole line.
* **New:** Brand new Saved Search editor so you can edit your saved searches from the menu bar and hide the sidebar if you want.
* **New:** You can disable search highlighting in the note editor with a new setting. Disabling will not highlight search term occurrences visually and will not scroll down until the first match is visible.
* **New:** Continuation of blockquote markers now works just like list markers: hit Enter in a blockquote environment and the new line will start with a `>`, too.

## v0.4.2 (2017-10-04)

* **Fixed:** Hard-to-explain issue of outdated search results. Say you searched for the ID `201709300742` through clicking on a link. Then you got 2 results, one with the link, one of the note itself. Then you renamed the note's title, keeping the ID, and clicked the same link again -- poof, note was gone. That's because clicking a link cleared the "old known notes" cache; but since the search term was the same, it did not perform the search request.
* **Fixed:** Once you edited a note in your current workspace (= your search results), switching back to the note later will put the text editing caret where you left it off instead to the first search term match.
* **Fixed:** Typing in the Omnibar did not live-update the search highlight inside the note, if any, until you switched to the editor view.
* **Fixed:** The error reporting dialog now includes the correct build number.
* **Fixed:** After launch, the notes are in the expected sort order from last time instead of resetting to "Title Ascending".
* **Changed:** Renamed "Filters" to "Saved Searches" for now. Real filters will be different, more like in v0.1, where you could activate a filter and search inside the confines of its context.
* **Changed:** Adding emphasis using <kbd>⌘I</kbd> or <kbd>⌘B</kbd> now puts the caret in between the marks when you don't have anything selected.
* **Changed:** Removed `$` to denote math markup because the Markdown extension was matching text too eagerly.
* **Changed:** Invoking a search using a saved search now auto-selects a matching note by the same rules a manual search would, so you can write index notes for your saved searches.
* **New:** Naive-ish continuation of list environments when you hit the newline. Will also continue inside code blocks, which is not ideal, but we'll get there.

## v0.4.1 (2017-09-29)

* **Fixed:** Removing a note from the file system that's part of the search results now displays a cached version of the note before it was deleted. You can edit it and never know somebody removed the file from your archive directory. This is another measure to ensure reliable search results consistency.

## v0.4.0 (2017-09-27)

The motto of the 0.4 version branch is _reliability_. We're approaching a first stable public release, folks.

* **Fixed:** Delete note, undo, redo, then undo again -- this used to report an error because the re-creation was attempted twice.
* **Fixed:** Remembering and scrolling to the old caret position got in the way when you did not tab but clicked into the editor. When you click, your caret now lands below the mouse cursor again.
* **New:** Search results are treated as your temporary contents "on the desk", being exempt from (most) file system changes:

    * Creating a new note with ⌘N while a search is active displays the new note even though it doesn't match the search criteria.
    * Removing the search term contents from a note does not remove it from the search results immediately anymore.


## v0.3.11 (2017-09-20)

* **Fixed:** When searching in a note and then typing, the cursor sometimes used to jump back to the first occurrence of the search term while you typed.
* **New:** Remember text selection/cursor position in notes.

For this release, I created an open source library to store the text selection in file metadata, called [`SwiftXAttrs`](https://github.com/CleanCocoa/SwiftXattrs). All in all, I thus published 6 libraries so far during development.

## v0.3.10 (2017-09-15)

I replaced the way notes are stored internally. Previously, your files on disk were the dominant source of information; now it's the content in main memory. This has a ton of consequences, like sped-up response times when creating and editing notes -- because while changes are still stored to disk, the changes appear in memory first, and they do appear fast.

Should fix, among other things:

- file conflicts when renaming
- note creation errors when hitting "Enter" twice too quickly

## v0.3.9 (2017-09-07)

* **Fixed:** Full-screen mode toggling did not adjust the lowest possible caret position in typewriter mode.
* **Fixed:** Reading files with broken encoding falls back to _something_ instead of skipping the note.
* **Changed:** Improved performance of the Markdown highlighting when changing notes rapidly.
* **Changed:** Support `§` in hashtags.

## v0.3.8 (2017-08-23)

* **Fixed:** Undoing surrounding text with Markdown emphasis markup produced the wrong "original" text when it was itself a bracket or syntax element.
* **Fixed:** List items on multiple lines are now indented correctly for non-monospaced fonts.
* **Fixed:** Changing the main window to fullscreen mode and back again sometimes made the centered text column too small.
* **Fixed:** Searching inside the note (⌘F) previously broke the behavior of tabbing from the Omnibar to the editor.
* **Fixed:** First launch (or launch after deleting themes) does not show a white text editor anymore.
* **Fixed:** A cause of erratic scrolling when the displayed note text changed, maybe even on auto-save events.
* **Changed:** Picking a new filter icon now sports a regular and easy-to-notice button instead of the clever triangle.
* **New:** When navigating search results, <kbd>Cmd</kbd> and <kbd>Alt</kbd> plus the arrow keys lets you quickly jump to the beginning or end of the list.
* **New:** Search terms are highlighted within the note and the text scrolls down to make them visible.

## v0.3.7 (2017-08-18)

Focus on list and block editing:

* **Fixed:** If you had disabled Markdown highlighting, it would ignore the setting at next launch.
* **Fixed:** Deleting the opening parens of an auto-completed parens pair does not remove the first character after the parens anymore.
* **Changed:** Emboldening and italicizing selected text with the menu shortcuts now selects the resulting emphasized text instead of putting the caret at the end.
* **Changed:** Solarized theme's caret colors. (You have to delete existing files to have them copied over on launch.)
* **New:** "Select Line" in the Edit menu.
* **New:** "Find" shortcut (<kbd>Cmd-F</kbd>) works with focus in the Omnibar and the results list to search inside a note.
* **New:** Make any text into a list with the new "Switch List Type" (<kbd>Cmd-T</kbd>) format option! _Note: Suggestions for a better term than "switch" are very welcome. I cannot recall which English verb expresses going in circles between the options here the best. For 2, it'd be "toggle", but for 3...?_
* **New:** You can indent and outdent lines of text by selecting text and hitting <kbd>tab</kbd> (or use <kbd>Cmd-]</kbd> and <kbd>Cmd-[</kbd>, popular for English keyboard layouts; or <kbd>Alt-Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift-Alt-Tab</kbd> for the rest of us).
* **New:** When you hit Enter/Return in an indented line, the new line will be indented as well.
* **New:** You can now comment the selected text with <kbd>Cmd-/</kbd> or from the "Format" menu.

## v0.3.6 (2017-08-12)

* **Fixed:** Captured images from your webcam now produce a valid path with percent encoding.
* **Changed:** The Quick Entry window now has a sensible minimum size.
* **Changed:** The text editing caret is now twice as fat!
* **Changed:** Typing brackets (and Markdown syntax stuff) right in front of existing text now does not insert the closing brackets anymore.
* **New:** Bold (⌘B) and italics (⌘I) shortcuts. You can set your preferred Markdown emphasis character in the "Editing" preferences.
* **New:** You can set which external editor is used when you hit "Open with External Editor" (⇧⌘E).
* **New:** Links to images in the media subfolder are now clickable.
* **New:** Your preferences for spell checking, quote substitution, and things like that are now saved between launches.

## v0.3.5 (2017-08-08)

* **Fixed:** Markdown list items starting with a `-` were not indented properly.
* **Fixed:** With Typewriter Mode and Markdown highlighting enabled, you couldn't scroll up without the app snapping back to the insertion point in the text.
* **Fixed:** Pre-installer filter icon picker shows icons at their proper size.
* **Fixed:** Right-click contextual menu works again in the search results list.
* **Fixed:** Keyboard shortcuts (cut, copy, paste) and text expansion apps should now work in the Quick Entry panel.
* **Changed:** The Quick Entry panel's optional title text field is styled like the content text field.
* **Changed:** You can now edit text of error reports before composing the email to redact the contents.

## v0.3.4 (2017-08-06)

* **Changed:** Improved Markdown syntax highlighting. Lists now indent more beautifully. I love lists. And I love how they behave now. I bet you'll love it, too.
* **New:** Themes.

## v0.3.3 (2017-07-28)

* **New:** Live Markdown syntax highlighting. It's awfully hungry for energy at the moment, especially for larger files, so you can disable it from the main menu if needed.

That's about all I've been working on, shockingly.

## v0.3.2 (2017-07-18)

* **Fixed:** Hashtags now support umlauts, chinese characters, and whatever else is considered a letter according to Unicode.
* **Fixed:** When you click out of the text editor and then back again, you can now undo changes from before clicking away.
* **Fixed:** Renaming a note to include a `/` resulted in an error.
* **Fixed:** An error when using a note title with illegal file name characters in the Quick Entry Helper.
* **Changed:** Reverted replacing colons in filenames. It's enough to take care of `/` to make macOS's file system happy.
* **New:** Remember the insertion point in the text when you tab out of the note and then back again. Makes shortcut-heavy workflows in the same note easier, like ⌘L + ⌘C (copy note title) + Tab + ⌘V (paste title into text).
* **New:** For dark and very bright backgrounds, use a tasty blue-ish caret color.

## v0.3.1 (2017-07-17)

* **Fixed:** Switching the displayed note did scroll far to the bottom of the note. Now it starts at the beginning again.
* **Fixed:** Show filter sidebar slide-out thingies again.
* **Fixed:** After renaming a note, delayed file saving changes resulted in periodic replacement of the editor content with outdated text. Extremely annoying when you were still typing!
* **Fixed:** The insertion point or selection is preserved when the note updates in the background, for example due to a file change with an external editor.
* **Changed:** Activating a filter via shortcuts or sidebar or menu item closes the current note and puts focus inside the Omnibar so you can navigate more quickly.
* **New:** Plain-text quotation marks (`"` and `'`) behave like brackets: you can wrap the selected text with them, and they always come in pairs.

## v0.3.0 (2017-07-15)

* **Fixed** Crash on launch for macOS El Capitan.
* **New:** Typewriter scrolling!
* **New:** Autocompletion and selection wrapping with brackets, underscores, and asterisks! Select a text, hit `*`, and it'll be surrounded by default!

For this release, I created an open source library for the Typewriter stuff, aptly called [`Typewriter-Modes`](https://github.com/CleanCocoa/Typewriter-Modes), so this project produced 5 libraries so far.

## v0.2.10 (2017-06-28)

* **Fixed:** Replace ":" and "/" in file names with "-". Dropping files into the Omnibar and hitting enter now doesn't crash anymore.
* **Fixed:** Display glitches for long notes when hiding the sidebars.
* **Fixed:** Insertion point in the text editor is nudged up to look more conventional.* **Changed:** Performance when handling huge archives is improved. Search results still do not appear instantly, but it's better.
* **Fixed:** Sidebar width or it being hidden is preserved across program launches.
* **Changed:** Renamed "Close Archive" to "Switch Archives".
* **Changed:** Deleting a note does select the Omnibar with the note's title, but it does not empty the Omnibar anymore.
* **New:** Added "Copy Title" to the search result contextual menu.
* **New:** Display an error report with a list of files that cannot be read after launch instead of showing a serious error alert for each file.
* **New:** Without a selection, hitting the up-arrow inside the Omnibar selects the last item in the search result list.

## v0.2.8 (2017-06-24)

* **Fixed:** Changing the file you are editing from another app does not lose your current changes in The Archive. (Dropbox sync used to reset the file sometimes to the previously saved version. Also, editing a file and clicking a `[[Wiki Link]]` sometimes did lose the changes when showing the target note.)
* **Changed:** Reorganized the "Editing" prefereces.

## v0.2.7 (2017-06-23)

* **Fixed:** Fix revealing same note in finder twice not doing anything.
* **Fixed:** Fix editing same note in default editor twice not doing anything.
* **Fixed:** Undo note deletion selects the restored note properly, showing the title in the Omnibar.
* **Fixed:** The "Don't show this message again" setting for the deletion alert is preserved. You can re-enable this at the bottom of the "General" preferences.
* **Fixed:** Font preview box displays the top of the font now and grows taller.
* **Fixed:** Changing archives closes the main window.
* **Changed:** Hitting ESC or ⌘. in the text editor resets the search.
* **Changed:** Saving note changes preserves the creation date.
* **Changed:** After deleting a note, the Omnibar is cleared.
* **Changed:** Improved startup times (a.k.a. initial indexing of all notes is faster).
* **Changed:** When you click a hashtag, the Omnibar is focused now.

## v0.2.6 (2017-06-18)

* **Fixed:** Filter menu shortcuts work now even before you peek at the menu.
* **Fixed:** The clear button now hides itself again.
* **Fixed:** Tabbing out of editing a note's title now puts the focus into the text editor instead of the Omnibar.
* **Fixed:** On macOS Sierra, the search result backgrounds now don't have the see-through effect anymore.
* **Fixed:** Fast typing sometimes made the whole Omnibar contents be selected so that the next keystroke would overwrite everything. This was because the search results wrongly triggered a selection event. Doesn't happen anymore.
* **Changed:** Disable text substitutions in the editor pane.
* **Changed:** Omnibar title suggestions don't remember the last suggestion anymore. So if you search for "2017" first, get a suggestion, then start anew with "20", the old "2017..." suggestion is now discarded.
* **New:** "Reveal in Finder" (⌘⇧R) added below "Notes" menu.
* **New:** "Open with External Editor" (⌘⇧E) added below "Notes" menu.

## v0.2.5 (2017-06-12)

* **Fixed:** Notes are now sorted in a natural-language way, so "10" comes between "9" and "11", not between "1" and before "2".
* **Fixed:** Starting the app shows all notes. (At least I couldn't reproduce the problem anymore.)
* **Fixed:** Flickering in the editor window when searching for notes.
* **Fixed:** Clicking a `[[WikiLink]]` will always select the matching note. Previously, a bug sometimes cleared the selection in the results list.
* **Fixed:** Tabbing from Omnibar to the editor works again.
* **Fixed:** Moving the result selection with the down-arrow key from the Omnibar now doesn't jiggle the scroll position at the bottom anymore.
* **Changed:** Improved type-for-filtering reaction speed for large archives.
* **Changed:** Improved scrolling and keyboard-based selection change speed in results view.
* **Changed:** Improved performance of command-tabbing back into the app. It took about a second previously.
* **Changed:** Double-click in the results list starts editing, _even when the note was selected already._
* **New:** Added contextual menu (right-click menu) to the results list for deleting and renaming notes.

## v0.2.3 & v0.2.4 (2017-06-07)

* **Fixed:** Window can resize vertically again.
* **Fixed:** Flickering and sometimes lost selection in the results list when clicking a `[[WikiLink]]`, problems introduced in v0.2.2.

## v0.2.2 (2017-06-06)

* **Fixed:** Clicking a `[[WikiLink]]` to a matching note selects and shows the contents of the best match so you don't have to click inside the search result list.
* **Fixed:** Filter shortcuts were gone from the main menu. Now they're back again.
* **Fixed:** A ton of issues with the Omnibar. Again. It should be more reliable now. I will not say it's 100% working, because this little bugger showed me quite often how to crush my coding confidence, but it's _close!_
* **Changed:** Selecting a filter now replaces the search completely instead of appending pieces to it.
* **New:** You can now configure which file extensions The Archive should use for note files.

And another open source library, resulting in 4 libraries from this project! The new one is called [`Omnibar`](https://github.com/CleanCocoa/Omnibar). Guess what it's for :)

## v0.2.1 (2017-05-27)

This release has many small fixes and a lot of bigger changes. The list sums up some of them, but the behavior and "feel" of interacting with the app should have improved. Whatever you notice, please email me with your opinion on the changes and where you experience most friction.

* **Fixed:** The Omnibar behaves better. There were so many weird edge cases whenever I fixed one thing that I lost track of what has changed. But the problems are gone and the behavior should be just fine.
* **Fixed:** Hitting enter in the Omnibar didn't start editing the note when the note wasn't selected.
* **Fixed:** Selecting an archive directory that is not readable/writable presents an alert instead of silently failing.
* **Changed:** The search is now a whole magnitude faster. In turn, the auto-completion got more reliable better.
* **Changed:** Filters work differently now. They immediately affect your search and don't create a subset of your notes in a hidden fashion.
* **Changed:** Clicking a `[[Wiki Link]]` no longer creates non-existing notes. These links are now just search shortcuts.
* **New:** Background auto-saving of note changes every 5 seconds.

## v0.1.8 (2017-05-20)

* **Fixed:** After launch, not all notes where displayed for everybody. Should now be fixed. It's hard to reproduce, so please send reports with log files if it still happens!
* **Fixed:** Deleting notes in large archives did not always remove the note from the search results list. Now it does.
* **Fixed:** Deleting notes that were created in the Quick Entry helper as soon as possible triggered an error, too. Had the same latency-dependent reason as the fix above this one. Time sucks.


## v0.1.7 (2017-05-19)

* **Fixed:** Deletion bug where the wrong note was attempted to be removed.
* **Fixed:** Renaming bug that performed the change on disk but displayed an error nevertheless.
* **Fixed:** Hitting enter in the Omnibar did not always began editing the note.
* **Changed:** Hashtags in brackets or quotes are now clickable.
* **New:** "Capture Image" in the edit menu lets you create snapshots to quickly include drawings into your notes.
* **New:** Configure the path where snapshots are stored relative to your archive. Defaults to `./media/`.

This release introduces yet another open source library I created, now 3 in total. This one's called [`WebcamSnap`](https://github.com/CleanCocoa/WebcamSnap).

## v0.1.6 (2017-05-16)

* **Fixed:** Clicking a hashtag does not deselect the currently visible note.
* **Fixed:** Don't select a random note after start.
* **Fixed:** Keep note selected in the results list when the search results change.

## v0.1.5 (2017-05-15)

* **Fixed:** Archive is faster when reacting to links. -- Is performance a "fix"? Well, higher reliability is! Medium-sized archives (Sascha's and mine with 4800 and 3800 notes resp.) didn't always follow clicked `[[Wiki Link]]`s. If you had looked at the event log, you'd see that a lot of stuff would go on, sometimes leading to showing the note with the link again instead of the link target. But no more!
* **Fixed:** The Omnibar. Like, in total. There were so many different edge cases over the last couple days that I cannot recall what was wrong initially. Especially in large archives with the current _SuperSlowSearch_™ it became unusable. Look out for this:
    * When you click a `[[WikiLink]]`, the Omnibar should display the link text. If the target note is not among the filtered search results, reset the search to display it in the results list. Keep the search as it was otherwise.
    * When you click a `#hashtag`, the Omnibar should display the tag as search term, ultimately resetting the search. (But not the active filter!)
    * When you type, the Omnibar should show the characters you've typed, no matter how slow the search. Your will is its command.
    * When you type and a note among the search results begins with your search term, the Omnibar should auto-complete your input and display the note in anticipatory obedience.
    * When you delete parts of the search, auto-completion should not be active. Only when you type. Also, the display should reset to "nothing".
* **Changed:** Perceived performance when searching is better. When you type faster than the _SuperSlowSearch_™ can sift through your notes, you won't be interrupted, the app won't freeze, and it won't show outdated auto-completion suggestions. On the flip side, if you want to see intermediate search results in huge archives, you have to wait at the end. This is an interesting psychological effect: Since the typing up until the end is now undelayed, the single and final delay feels like an eternity. Before, you got used to the slow response time. It was annoying, too, but different.
* **Changed:** Printing is disabled for now because the system's default is pretty useless. Will come back with a revenge later during the beta.
* **Changed:** Changing a note but then undoing the change no longer touches and overwrites the file to reduce disk load. (And to keep the event log smaller. 😁)

## v0.1.4 (2017-05-12)

* **Fixed:** Hiding the sidebar does not shrink but grow the note text editor as expected.
* **Fixed:** Filename conflicts when renaming notes are now resolved by appending `.1`, `.2`, `.3`, ... (whichever is free) to the desired title.
* **Fixed:** Clicking on `#hashtag` links now searches for notes with that phrase instead of creating a note called `#hashtag`. `[[Wiki Links]]` still work as expected: they search for a note starting with the link content or create a new note if none exists.
* **Changed:** Sorting options in View > Sort By are now less clever and say what you'll get on the tin.


## v0.1.3 (2017-05-12)

* **Fixed:** Window and results list sizes are restored when re-opening the app.
* **Fixed:** `[[Wiki links]]` are now clickable when you add parens around them. Or punctuation marks.
* **Fixed:** The directory selection panel now shows the "New Folder" button y'all have been missing so badly.
* **Fixed:** Searching in the Omnibar now does not replace the case you typed in when auto-completing suggestions. So if you have a note called "Banana" and you type "ban", the Omnibar will show "banana". Also, this way you can start note titles with different cases than existing notes starting with the same letter :) (Thanks to Rocco Nicosia for finding that one!)
* **Changed:** The results list shows numbers in monospaced variant so your note IDs are all of the same width.
* **Changed:** Before deleting a note, you'll now get a confirmation dialog.
* **Changed:** The archive selection window is now less ugly.
* **Changed:** The divider of note editor and search results is now thicker for better partitioning of the space available.
* **New:** The help menu has new items to send feedback and get to this website.

## v0.1.2 (2017-05-10)

* **Fixed:** Double-hash hashtags (`##example`) are now clickable. Sascha uses them for broader categories in his archive.
* **Fixed:** Creating an empty note now selects and edits the new note automatically.
* **Fixed:** Clicking a link triggers a search (and puts the cursor into the Omnibar). If there is a partial matching note (a note that starts with the link anchor text), that note will be selected and editing starts. This way you can use wiki links to IDs like `[[201705101030]]` and jump to the note right away.
* **Fixed:** Creating a new note aborted editing after a couple of seconds because the Finder/file system updates the file in the background again. These background refreshers should not affect your active editing session anymore.
* **Fixed:** Changing a note, then focusing the Omnibar deselected the note and displayed "Nothing Selected" instead of the note's text.
* **Fixed:** Quick entry helper updates with colors and font changes.
* **New:** You can change the font size of the search results list on the left. BIGGER TEXT FOR EVERYBODY!

## v0.1.1 (2017-05-09)

* **Fixed:** entering an existing note title in the Omnibar, then hitting enter, previously resulted in an attempt to create the same note twice.
* **Fixed:** The Omnibar now shows the title of the selected note as you change the selection.
* **Fixed:** The note editor now scrolls. For real.
* **New:** Typing in the Omnibar selects a note from the results that starts with the exact title. Since IDs are at the beginning, this is pretty much useless for regular Zettel notes unless I make the archive "Zettel-aware", that is treat notes with IDs differently.
* **New:** Hitting Enter in an empty Omnibar creates an empty note and displays it.
* **New:** "X"-button to clear the selection added to the Omnibar.
* **New:** ⌘C (copy) from the search results list is now possible.
* **New:** The search results's background color now changes with the editor color.
* **New:** You can specify the minimum inner distance between the editor text field's border and the text, also known as inset or padding.
* **Changed:** Searching inside a note using ⌘F does not display a separate window anymore but the more modern "search bar" at the top.

**Known issue:** replacing content from the search bar is not undoable.

## v0.1.0 (2017-04-28)

I won't list everything I did to get this first useful version up and running (and kinda polished, compared to my first TableFlip build) because "a running app with functionality" is pretty self-explanatory already. We have text file editing, a quick entry helper, editor style preferences, and filter management, basically.

Instead, here are some fun facts:

* Thanks to all the open source libraries I use (including self-made ones), the overhead affecting the file size is huge: this version takes up 38&nbsp;MB of disk space. 😱 Is this really the future? Then again, any Electron-based app (like Slack, VisualStudio Code, Atom, and numerous others) will need at least 110&nbsp;MB because there's a full Chrome browser included.
* I started my first experiment in code on 19th November, 2016. (And I didn't do anything for most of March thanks to my post-op.)
* It took 697 source code repository commits (= micro milestones I checked in) to get this far.
* With 921 unit test cases, this is the project with the most automated test I ever wrote on my own. (Projects where I did work in a team had significantly less tests, by the way.)
* I extracted and published 2 new open source libraries in the process, [`FatSidebar`](https://github.com/CleanCocoa/FatSidebar) and [`BetaExpiration`](https://github.com/CleanCocoa/BetaExpiration), and updated another one that I published back when I released TableFlip for beta, called [`ErrorHandling`](https://github.com/CleanCocoa/ErrorHandling).

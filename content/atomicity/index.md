If you don't have any idea about the principle of atomicity, start with the [Complete Guide to Atomicity](https://zettelkasten.de/atomicity/guide/). It will provide all the bells and whistles associated with this principle. For a teaser summary: Atomicity marries the Zettelkasten Method with principles of sound thinking. Atomicity is one step in your journey. Note-taking is no longer a chore. It becomes a discipline. Each atomic note is a training session for the craftsmanship of knowledge, bringing you one step closer to mastering knowledge craftsmanship.

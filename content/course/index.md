## About Me as a Teacher and My Zettelkasten

Expect me to be

1. Intense
2. Involved
3. Demanding
4. Very Generous with my Energy and Time (thanks Nir for this compliment!) when you put in your effort.

I am using my Zettelkasten and develop the method for over a decade now. I am a coach for health and fitness for 15 years. Expect a coach who has a lot of experience and is a seasoned Zettelkasten practitioner himself.

> You have such a dedication to knowledge that is very inspiring and you manage to communicate this dedication in the course.
> 
> In terms of the course content I find the combination of Deep Work and the Atom to be the most transformative notion, usually when I tried to build my zettelkasten before the course I did either: meandering through a topic and finding links to other concepts or just briefly jotting down (until now I tried to build a physical zk with actual paper zettles!) something quickly not working through the concept very deeply.
> 
> I also found the analogy of knowledge work as physical exercise very useful. With workout you get results from being careful with what you do and how you do it (e.g. "junk miles" as supposed to deliberately training in zone 2 or zone 5). Same with knowledge: use better methods and get better results.

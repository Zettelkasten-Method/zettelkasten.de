In this video, I coach Ashish on using the Zettelkasten Method to study Hindu philosophy. Hindu philosophy is an ideal domain for learning how to use a Zettelkasten to manage complex, seemingly endless topics. One major challenge is [atomicity](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/create-zettel-from-reading-notes/), as each idea can be explored in greater [depth](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/how-to-explore-depth-of-idea-knowledge-flower/), often requiring notes to be broken down repeatedly. To avoid getting lost, you'll need to develop both tolerance for this process and a disciplined approach to structuring your work.

I hope you enjoy this session:

In this video, I coach Fernando on how to create depth in his knowledge work using the **Knowledge Flower**, a core framework for increasing the value of information and turning it into knowledge. It is a thinking tool rooted in my ongoing research on the value of knowledge. If you want to explore the fascinating topic of the value of knowledge, read the article [The Value of Knowledge](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-value/), which offers a great starting point through a philosophical lens. My own research extends beyond philosophical musings and aims to develop practical thinking tools.

If you want to learn, through an example, how to discover the depth of an idea and build knowledge value, this video is a must-watch.

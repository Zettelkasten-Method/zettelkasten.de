This is the last session of this little series of developing a knowledge work practice with Nori.

**Background:** Nori wrote [an article on leaving her Zettelkasten for good](https://www.noriparelius.com/post/goodbye-zettelkasten/). The quality of her reflection led to my decision to contact her with the offer for a couple of coaching sessions. After two coaching sessions ([watch the first recording here](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/noris-zettelkasten-journey-why-she-let-it-go-interview/)), she overhauled her system of knowledge work for which she wrote [an article to reflect on our coaching](https://www.noriparelius.com/post/thiniking-in-an-overstimulating-world/) and what is next for her.

Before the recording, we developed a session plan. The session revolved around two goals:

1. Reviewing her system and assessing if each step will deliver the outcome Nori is aiming for.  
2. Moving beyond note-taking. The core question that Nori posed was: "What does it actually mean to make an idea your own?"

We used two sample notes as material. But it was an open session, so we covered a wider range of topics. I am very happy with this session, since Nori left the session with clarity and momentum. As a coach, a heuristic for a good session is that if the coachee doesn't feel exhausted entirely directly after the session, but feels a delayed dip in energy. It is a sign that there was a good session flow and allowed us to stretch beyond our limits in a good way. Like any good training session for anything, mental or physical, you should feel engaged and elevated during the session, which masks fatigue for a while.

This is our session. Have fun and depth:

Happy atomic note-making, Nori -- and the rest of you, too.

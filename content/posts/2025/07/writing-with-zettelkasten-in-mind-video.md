The following video is a recorded coaching session on how to write with the Zettelkasten in mind. We talk about

- the differences between short- and long-form writing with the Zettelkasten;
- how to work with the Zettelkasten so that the values that you want to ship with your writing pieces are already present in your notes;
- and much more.

Have fun!
